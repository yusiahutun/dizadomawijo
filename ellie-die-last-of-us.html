As in the game, the season one finale prompts viewers with one of the great moral conundrums. For the uninitiated,&nbsp;The Last of Us&nbsp;is set 20 years after a devastating pandemic that wiped out most of humankind. The disease, a parasitic fungus known as&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Cordyceps</a>, quickly overtakes the host’s body and mind.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Horribly mutated</a>&nbsp;and aggressive, they become what’s known as “the infected”. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal and heartbreaking journey as they both must traverse the US and depend on each other for survival.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pedro-pascal-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lily-rose-depp.png><h2>Does Ellie die in The Last of Us season one finale?</h2><p>Does Ellie die in The Last of Us season one finale? The answer is no; Ellie doesn’t die in the video game either, but as we said, it’s complicated. As Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie near their destination—the headquarters where a resistance group called the Fireflies are working on finding a cure—they’re ambushed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pedro-Pascal-The-Last-of-Us.jpg><p>When Joel awakes, he finds himself in a hospital bed with the leader of the Fireflies, Marlene, standing watch over him. He asks to see Ellie; Marlene says he can’t as she’s being prepped for surgery. Marlene explains their doctor’s theory that the cordyceps have grown with Ellie since birth and as such have assimilated into her body, completely making her immune. The plan is to remove the cells from Ellie’s body and multiply them so that they may send the same chemical messages to other infected people and thus, produce a cure.</p><p>“But cordyceps grow inside the brain,” Joel observes. He quickly realizes that the surgery meant to find a cure will also kill Ellie in the process. Despite Marlene feeling an emotional connection to Ellie (she was there when she was born, after all), the resistance fighter says she has “no other choice.” Marlene orders the Fireflies to escort Joel back to the highway and if he tries to escape or fight his way back, they are to shoot him.</p><p>In typical Joel fashion, he doesn’t take too kindly to that. He manages to grab a gun off one of the soldiers and fight his way back to Ellie. He finds her in an operating theater and demands she be unhooked from all the medical instruments. When the surgeon threatens Joel with a scalpel, Joel shoots him in the head. The nurses do as he asks and Joel walks out of the hospital with an unconscious Ellie, who’s still under general anesthetic.</p><p>In the hospital parking lot, Marlene confronts Joel. “You can’t keep her safe forever. No matter how hard you try, no matter how many people you kill, she’s going to grow up, Joel,” she says. “You’ll die, she’ll leave, then what? How long until she’s torn apart by infected or murdered by raiders because she lives in a broken world that you could’ve saved?” He responds: “Maybe, but it isn’t for you to decide.” Marlene interrupts. “Or you, so what would she decide? Cos I think she’d want to do what’s right and you know it. It’s not too late, even now,” she says. In the game, Marlene tells Joel: “You can still do the right thing here. She won’t feel anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joel-Ellie-The-Last-of-Us-copy.jpg><p>The next shot cuts to Joel driving a car down the highway with Ellie for whom the anesthetic is beginning to wear off. We learn through brief flashbacks that Joel has also shot Marlene. When Ellie asks what happened and why she’s wearing a hospital gown, Joel lies to her. “Turns out there’s a whole lot more like you, people that are immune. Dozens of them,” he says. “The doctors couldn’t make any of it work. They’ve actually stopped looking for a cure. Raiders attacked the hospital; I barely got you out of there.”</p><p>We find out they’re making their way back to Tommy’s settlement in Jackson, Wyoming, and as Joel and Ellie do the last five miles on foot, Ellie pauses for a moment. She ponders all the loved ones she’s lost to the cordyceps: her first love Riley, Joel’s partner Tess and young Sam, Henry’s younger brother who was bitten and killed in episode five. She then says to Joel: “Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies is true.” He replies: “I swear.” She nods: “OK.” Fade to black and that’s the end of season one. It’s almost scene for scene in the video game, too.</p><p>Troy Baker, who voices Joels in the Naughty Dog/Sony video games, The Last of Us Part I and Part II, spoke of how having a son changed his opinion on the choice Joel makes by saving Ellie and robbing humanity of finding a cure. “I have a son, and I don’t know what I would look like if I lost him,” he explained while interviewed at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Milan Games Week</a> in 2022. “But I do know that if I had the opportunity to save him I would do anything. I would do anything to save him. So people have asked me, why would Joel do that when he could have saved the world, and my answer to them is always this — he did, he did save the world. It’s just that the world was that girl, and that’s it.”</p><p>The Last of Us is available to stream on HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
