Never miss important updates</strong></p><h2>Early life</h2><p class=align-left>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was born on April 16, 1947, in Harlem, New York. His birth name was Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor, but he preferred to go by Lew Alcindor. He is of mixed ethnicity. His father had Trinidadian and Yoruba roots, while his mother was of Cherokee descent.</p><p class=align-left>Both parents were quite tall – his father measuring 6 feet 1 inch and his mother standing at 5 feet 11 inches. He inherited their genes; he was 22 inches tall during his birth. Growing up, Kareem found it hard to fit in, especially at school. By the time he was nine years, he was 5 feet 8 inches tall.</p><p class=align-left>His height came in handy in <a href=#>basketball,</a> a sport he played since he was a kid. By the time Kareem was entering high school, he had perfected the game. Furthermore, his height – 6 feet 8 inches – made him a dominant figure on the basketball court. As a result, he was recruited by several high schools.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2f7538c3c19e86d9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Hasbulla Magomedov? Medical condition, life expectancy, family, height</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ultimately, he decided to attend Power Memorial High School on a scholarship. Kareem played for Power Memorial (based in New York) right from his first year. He led the team to a 79-2 overall record (with 71 straight wins) and two national championships. He also set a New York City High School scoring record of 2,067 points.</p><p class=align-left>Kareem was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">widely recruited by colleges</a>, with over 60 institutions seeking him out. He chose to attend UCLA, where he was placed on the first-year team since first-year students weren't allowed to play for varsity. His impact on the team was so significant that his team defeated the varsity team despite the latter being two-time national defending champions.</p><p class=align-left>Kareem joined UCLA's varsity team during his sophomore year. In his first game, he scored 56 points, setting a new record. After that, he led the<a href=#> college</a> team to a national championship after an undefeated season of 30 wins.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/115adb5237903cd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Burak Deniz bio: wife, family, religion, height, TV shows</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1857807c1add7829.jpg><p class=align-left>During the season, he was considered too dominant such that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NCAA banned dunking</a>, one of his top moves, to curtail him. Kareem’s dominance on the court continued for the rest of his college career. He led the UCLA team to an 88-2 record and three straight NCAA national championship wins.</p><p class=align-left>He was named the national player of the year in three consecutive years. Other achievements include a 47 game winning streak, three times NCAA Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament, and three consecutive Helms Foundation Player of the Year awards.</p><h2>NBA career</h2><p class=align-left>Several professional basketball teams attempted to recruit Kareem after college. He was even offered $1 million by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harlem Globetrotters</a> – an exhibition team – but he turned the offer down to play in the NBA. Milwaukee Bucks drafted him in the 1969 draft as the first pick.</p><p class=align-left>He had also been drafted by the American Basketball Association side, New York Mets, but chose to accept Bucks's offer. Kareem played for Milwaukee Bucks until 1975 when he moved to Los Angeles Lakers. He spent the rest of his career at L.A., retiring in 1989 after 20 seasons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/42dd85bdb41113e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=33><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shannon Sharpe: net worth, wife, kids, brother, college, height, weight</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His dominance on the court was legendary; he was the all-time NBA leading scorer with 38,387 points when he retired. In addition, he recorded 3,189 blocks, 9,394 rebounds, and 1,074 wins from 1560 <a href=#>games</a>.</p><h2>Coaching career</h2><p class=align-left>After retiring, Kareem ventured into coaching, wanting to pass on his knowledge. However, despite being an NBA legend, he did not land any high coaching profile jobs. He attributed this to his advanced age; he was in his 50s when he wanted to start coaching.</p><p class=align-left>During his playing years, he had earned a reputation of being difficult after people misunderstood his being an introvert and media-shy for being aloof and rude. His coaching career started with Seattle SuperSonics and Los Angeles Clippers, where he worked as an assistant <a href=#>coach</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He also coached the United States Basketball League side, Oklahoma Storm, in 2002. Other coaching gigs include special assistant coach at L.A. Lakers, scout for New York Knicks, and volunteer coach at Alchesay High School in Arizona.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3076476e9e40d0f4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Canelo Alvarez: parents, wife, ethnicity, family, background</span></p></a><h2>Acting career</h2><p class=align-left>Aside from basketball, Kareem also tried his hand at acting.
