Kodak was subsequently signed to Atlantic Records. He became increasingly famous after his first studio album Painting Pictures was released in 2017. Kodak was compared to Lil Wayne, another Louisiana rapper who became famous at a young age. His style has also been compared to that of American rapper <a href=#>Boosie Badazz</a>, his greatest idol, with whom he shares an undisturbed, localized brawl.</p><p>His first mixtape Project Baby was released in 2013. Kodak Black is known for his hit singles No Flockin and Tunnel Vision and for his numerous run-ins with the law, although his music often revolves around past and future criminal misdeeds. His first arrest was for burglary, and he was not even 16 years old at the time of his arrest. Kodak got his first life sentence for car theft when he was in middle school. He was committed to a juvenile detention facility three times in one year and then put on probation.</p><h2><strong>Kodak Black Wiki</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kodak Black</a> was born on 11 June 1997 in Dieuson Octave in Pompano Beach, Florida. He started rapping in elementary school and after school, he went to a local trap house to record music. As an adult, he often read dictionaries and the thesaurus to improve his vocabulary. This helped him excel in school, as he beat the high school students in spelling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kodak-Black.jpg><p>At the age of 12, he ventured into rap after joining a rap group called Brutal Youngnz and taking the stage name J-Black. He later joined another local rap group called The Kolyons. When he joined Instagram, he adopted the username “Kodak Black,” which later became his stage name. In 2014, Kodak Black enrolled at Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach to earn his high school diploma.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo Wife, Children & How He Grew His Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>Octave was a controversial figure, especially because of his legal issues and his interactions with social media. His Instagram account set a record in January 2017 when he posted a live video of himself and six other men while a single woman performed some sexual acts on them. Later, he posted an unrepentant message about the incident on Twitter saying, “If I could change, I swear I would … I’ve tried everything, but I’m just so broken.</p><p>In June 2017, he commented on his preference for light-skinned girls over dark-skinned girls. This caused so much backlash on Twitter that he was forced to delete both his Instagram and his Twitter accounts.</p><h2><strong>Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>In early 2017, Kodak Black was associated with Danielle Bregoli, a 13-year-old television star who appeared in the music video for his song Everything 1k. Danielle refuted the rumors, however, and admitted that what she had with the rapper was just a working relationship.</p><p>In November 2017, a few days after he hinted on Instagram that he was ready to settle down, Kodak Black released a video of himself and his girlfriend Cuban Doll fooling around at an alleged engagement. In the alleged engagement video, Black threw a large pile of cash on the floor, took off one of his expensive rings, and gave it to her. In an apparent assumption, Cuban Doll picked up the money and sprayed herself with it when she screamed, “I’m married to that money.</p><h2><strong>Kodak Black Son</strong></h2><p>Kodak Black has a 3-year-old son named King Khalid Octave. According to reports, the rapper did not know the existence of the boy until he was one year old. He and the mother of his son, Jammiah Broomfield, had several problems with payment and custody of the child. The problems were solved when they reached an agreement with the rapper to pay $4,200 a month in child support until 2033. This also ensures the rapper regular access to his son.</p><p>The rapper also made an Instagram post in February 2017 in which he indicated that he was actually expecting another child with another woman. The post contained an ultrasound image, but it is not known whether the child’s mother is a friend or any woman.</p><h2><strong>Mom</strong></h2><p>Kodak’s parents had immigrated to Florida from Haiti. His mother’s name is Marcelene Octave and she raised him in Golden Acres, a public housing project in Pompano Beach. His father was absent for most of his teenage years.</p><p>Being Kodak Black’s mother has proven to be a bumpy road for Marcelene Octave because one minute he makes her really proud and the next he leaves her heartbroken. In 2016 Black released an Instagram video that showed the moment when his mother saw his feature in XXL magazine. The proud mother was visibly ecstatic as she scanned the magazine. According to reports, however, Black’s mother collapsed after a hearing of her son at which he was found guilty of violating house arrest.</p><h2><strong>Kodak Black </strong><strong>Height and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Teeth</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kodak-Black-Teeth.jpg><p>Kodak Black is 5-ft 9-inch height, the rapper is slim built and weighs about 165lbs. His chest circumference is about 38 inches, the biceps 13 inches, and the waist 32 inches.</p><p>Kodak Black has drastically changed his typical look by having all 24 gold teeth surgically removed the day after his 20th birthday. On his 20th birthday, all 24 gold teeth were removed. The rapper even went live on social media to allow fans to watch the surgery. The decision to remove his signature gold cup was a shock to many of his fans.</p><p>Initially, there was speculation that he had the gold grill removed because he was at risk of developing gum disease. But just a week after the gold teeth were removed, the rapper released two videos on Instagram showing a new diamond grill added to his teeth in the upper and lower rows.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chloe Moretz Biography, Childhood, Family Life, Feet, Net Worth, Boyfriend</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Is Kodak Black Gay?</strong></h2><p>Kodak Black’s sexual orientation is heterosexual. In 2017, however, the rapper had to shake off accusations of being a gay lover when a man published photos of him with the rapper posing as his boyfriend. The man with the Instagram handles @sgmybloodline posted photos of himself, arm in arm with a shirtless Kodak. The man also gave some clear details of their alleged relationship. The rapper later went to social media to dispel the rumors.</p><h2><strong>Is Kodak Dead?</strong></h2><p>Kodak Black may be in and out of prison, but he’s definitely alive. However, he was the victim of a fatality in 2016. An unidentified man posted a video from an alleged crime scene on the Internet claiming that the rapper was shot twice in the chest. The rumor was fuelled by the fact that the rapper, who is otherwise very active in social media, did not immediately refute it, which prompted many fans to express their condolences. Later, the rumor was dispelled by the rapper, who, however, received a boost in publicity through the fake story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuLCwwKRkm6SRmLhuw8ikoGaglZ60qcCMrZyerJhitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXq0u81mpKilXZyuunnIrGShnV2ZsqKwjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./loose-women-body-diversity-media-29343228.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Loose Women panellists pose in inspiring photo shoot ahead of International Women's Day">&larr;
