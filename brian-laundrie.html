They were posting their updates on social media regularly but they stopped doing so from August 1 and were later found to be missing.</p><h3>Brian Laundrie Wiki</h3><p>Brian Laundrie was born on 18th November 1997 who hails from Florida, USA. The name of his father is Christopher Laundriw while Roberts Richards is her mother and he also has a sister, Cassie as well. Along with her love Gabby, Brian Bayport attended Blue Point High School and was a lovely couple until the death of Gabby. Brian is a craftsman by occupation and also does modeling gigs a part of his passion.</p><h4>Speculation about Age</h4><p>There is a lot of buzz going around on social media about how old Brian actually is. It is because there are so many portals stated that his age is 37 years and he was born in 1984. Although the FBI official statement says that he is 23 years old and looking at the age of Gabby, it makes more sense because if Brian’s age is 37 years then her parents won’t allow their daughter to be in a relationship with almost 15 years older than her at the first place.</p><h3>Prime Suspect</h3><p>Petito, 22, and Laundrie, 23 both went road tripping in a white van from New York. All while covering their road trip; they kept posting their pictures and stories on their social media pages with the hashtag #vanlife. But all those posts abruptly stopped in late August. Meanwhile, Laundrie returned home without Petito in North Florida in the same van on September 1. Petito’s family is unable to reach out to her who reported their daughter’s missing report on 11th September 2021. The FBI is searching for Brian Laundrie’s family home in Florida since Monday, 20th September 2021.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u425006a0354d70c3eb88e4975fc845ff><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Charles Franklin Barnes Biography</span></a><p>They found his remains a day before the investigation started for his family. On Monday morning, the FBI searched for Laundrie’s parents’ home in North Port as the court issued the search warrant for him in Petito’s case. His parents were escorted a day before the search warrant was given on his name but the family was later brought back to questioning. The investigators have found several items from his house. On Monday, the FBI tweeted that the search has been finished but the investigation is still going out.</p><h3>FBI Investigation</h3><p>FBI is looking for Brian Laundrie who first returned home in Florida but without Petito earlier this month. He declined the investigations and later went missing last week. As being stated by the police officials, the search was going in nearby nature reserves but the investigation was later shifted when they found no way to Gabby Petito after completing their search. On Sunday, i.e, 19th September 2021, human remains that were resembled to be of Gabby Petito were found in an undeveloped camping area of Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest.</p><p>A postmortem examination has been scheduled for Tuesday to confirm the identity. Her story has now become the national obsession where digital detectives are combing through online posts and trails to solve the case. The story also highlighted the tens of thousands of people who went missing so far and could not be found later. According to National Crime Information Center, there were almost 90,000 active cases of people who all went missing till the end of 2020.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u8519032156f46e601888dbed78fa8ff2><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Gabby Petito Biography</span></a><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Brian Laundrie Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Brian Laundrie</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>November 18, 1997</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>23 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Craftsman</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Brian-Laundrie-1.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 8” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 173 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 72 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 158 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>9 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Bald</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Brian Laundrie Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Christopher Laundrie</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Roberta Richards</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>One (Cassie)</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Bayport Blue Point High&nbsp;School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Brian-Laundrie-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Who was his girlfriend?</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Gabby Petito</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Witnesses</h3><p>Officials are further trying to dig into more details when authorities on Monday found a recording of a man calling 911 and describing the woman who was being slapped. The recording is assumed to belong to Utah. In audio provided to CNN by the Grand Sherriff’s office in Utah, a caller is assumed to tell the officials on 911 that he reported a domestic dispute between a couple and was also described to be surrounded by a white van with a Florida license place. The caller said that we stopped when we saw a gentleman slapping the girl but they ran up and the man proceeded to hit her. They both hopped in the car and drove off.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub6963b822287c521582af30a470c8e97><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Griffin Kinard Biography</span></a><h4>Remains</h4><p>The case has further been reported to pathologists and during an investigation, they found a body remains on Sunday that is assumed to be of Gabby Petito. They will confirm the identity as the investigators need to know the cause of death. On the other hand, Gabby Petito’s family has been notified about the discovery. Her parents Joseph Petito and Nicole Schmidt hired an attorney and said that she touched the world.</p><p>Laundrie’s family attorney is calling the incident to be “heartbreaking” and said that we are praying for the family and Gabby too. Gabby was influenced by boys and was a fun-loving personality. Police officials have visited Laundrie’s family and are searching for Gabby Petito. However, Laundire’s family has refused to talk instead they hired an attorney to talk on their behalf.</p><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunCu0aKYp2WclsKvsNGinGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./guns-n-roses-loses-out-to-mlb.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guns N Roses Loses Out To MLB">&larr;
