Go adopt a child. Go change a child's life. There's so many kids of all ages and races who need adopting.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And if that's something that you're not willing or able to do, reach out to people like me and message us and show us love.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Say "hey, if you guys need anything ever, let us know, if you have any questions about anything whatsoever about raising a young black man, let us know. we'll be there for you."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It takes a village, guys. Reaching out to me and messaging me and letting me know you're there for me will change his life a lot more than telling me I can't do something.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Honestly, we're trying our best. we're giving him everything that we have. Being a father to him is seriously the best gift, the best thing that's ever happened to me.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The video received numerous supportive comments from all over the world.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One person commented: 'Do you bro, forget them haters. You'll do a hell of a job. Just raise him to be a good man and he'll be amazing.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another wrote: 'That baby is perfectly content in your arms; he feels the love! The gift of unconditional love is irreplaceable.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While another added: 'The color of your skin doesn't matter, it's the love for the child that matters.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However some people who commented did not agree with Steven and doubled down on their criticism of the couple's adoption choices.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One said: 'But you deflected the question. How are you going to prepare him for adulthood as a black man?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another added: 'If adoptive parents really just cared about what's best for the kid, they'd offer $ help to a parent who can't afford instead of taking their baby.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A third went a step further and said: 'So like why can't you guys adopt your own race?
