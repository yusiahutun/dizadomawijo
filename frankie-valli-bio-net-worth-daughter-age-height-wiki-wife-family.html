His greatest hits include Sherry, Working My Back, and Who Loves You.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Frankie Valli Bio</strong></h2><p>The great singer Francesco Stephen Castelluccio was born on May 3, 1934, in New Mark New Jersey, and grew up with his parents who supported and cared for him very much. His father, Anthony Castelluccio, was a hairdresser and designer, while his mother was a housewife and also worked for a beer company.</p><p>Frankie Valli is of Italian descent and has American citizenship. During his childhood, he developed an interest in becoming a singer after listening to an artist named Frank Sinatra to perform in New York City.</p><p>The young man also received a quality education that has contributed to his current successes.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Gina Darling Net Worth, Boyfriend, Age, Height, Quick Facts, and Wiki</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Professional Career</strong></h2><p>The talented singer began his singing career in the early 50s with the band Variety Trio. In those days of his humble beginnings, Valli had always had the desire to sing in public, and that dream began to see the light of day when he earned the opportunity to perform as a guest artist for the band Variety Trio.</p><p>Before Valli started performing constantly in the group, he worked especially hard on himself, listening to some of his favorite singers on records at home and then practicing what he heard. However, the great singer did not have Valli as a name, but he realized that he needed a stage name. Frankie Valli later changed his last name Castelluccio to “Valley” and finally to “Valli”.</p><p>Unfortunately, his band Variety Trio disbanded in 1952, but the star went to a house band at The Strand in New Brunswick, New Jersey, together with Tommy DeVito and joined a house band.</p><p>However, Frankie Valli released his first single in 1953, entitled “My Mother’s Eyes”. After a while, Valli and Tommy DeVito had to leave the house band of The Strand and formed a group called “The Variations”, which included Hank Majewski, Frank Cattone and Billy Thompson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The 4 Seasons</strong></h2><p>In 1956 the group name Variatones was changed to The Four Lovers and they recorded several albums. Two years later, in 1958, two members of the group, Nickie DeVito and Hank Majewski left and were later replaced by Nick Macioci and Hugh Garrity. The group continued to perform until 1959 when Bob Gaudio joined the group.</p><p>After a while, the name of the group was changed to “The 4 Seasons”. In their opinion, the name was inspired by a cocktail lounge where the group performed during an audition in 1960.</p><p>In the 1960s, the group was one of the most popular pop singers and their songs dominated the American music charts for a very long time and they produced many songs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>New Jersey Boys</strong></h2><p>Frank Valli received appropriate recognition for his achievements with the group New Jersey Boys, an award-winning music group in 2005, which has traveled the world in various traveling exhibitions, and in 2014 the group produced a song that was also incorporated into a film directed by Clint Eastwood.</p><p>For his immense commitment to his group and rock’n’roll music, Valli was inducted into the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, and in 1999 he was also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Frankie Valli Wife, Daughter, and Family</strong></h2><p>The opera singer was married three times, his first marriage was to Mary who had a two-year-old daughter before they met. The duo married in 1958 when Valli was in his early twenties, and they separated in 1971 after 13 years of marriage; both had a daughter.</p><p>He then married Mary Ann Hannagan a second time in 1874, and this time the marriage lasted only eight years and they were divorced.</p><p>After his second marriage failed, he made a third attempt and married Randy Clohessy in 1984. The couple had three sons, who also separated in 2004.</p><p>However, Valli had previously lost two daughters, the first in 1980 when he lost their daughter Celia in a fire, and six months later he lost Francine through drug abuse.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Rashaan Salaam Wiki, Bio, Cause Of Death, Wife, Children, Family, Gay</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Frankie Valli Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Talented singer Frankie Valli has an incredible net worth of $80 million in 2017 and earns his fortune through his work with the group The 4 Seasons and shows with the Jersey Boys.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts about Frankie Valli: Age/Height/Wiki</strong></h2><p><strong>Birth name:&nbsp;</strong>Francis Stephen Castelluccio</p><p><strong>Date of birth:&nbsp;</strong>May 3, 1934</p><p><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>83 years</p><p><strong>Birth City:&nbsp;</strong>Newark, New Jersey, United States</p><p><strong>Birth sign:&nbsp;</strong>Taurus</p><p><strong>Nationality:&nbsp;</strong>American</p><p><strong>Ethnicity:&nbsp;</strong>White</p><p><strong>Profession:&nbsp;</strong>Singer, Musician, Actor</p><p><strong>Known for:&nbsp;</strong>Four Lovers, The Four Seasons, and Jersey Boys</p><p><strong>Height:&nbsp;</strong>5 ft. 5 inches</p><p><strong>Married:</strong>&nbsp;Yes</p><p><strong>Divorced:&nbsp;</strong>Yes</p><p><strong>Spouse(s):&nbsp;</strong>Mary (m. 1958 – 1971),&nbsp;Mary Ann Hannagan (m. 1974 – 1982),&nbsp;Randy Clohessy (m. 1984 – 2004)</p><p><strong>Children:&nbsp;</strong>Francesco Valli, Antonia Valli, Francine Valli, Celia Valli, Brando Valli, and Emilio Valli</p><p><strong>Net Worth:&nbsp;</strong>$80 million</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ks7OtzaSgnmWmlrmttYyboKhlnprBbsPOq6uhZZSWwqi0056pZpmXmnqpscign61lp564qnnWop2eZZaWuqq42Gg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1-dead-after-motorcycle-vehicle-crash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UPDATE: Driver identified in fatal motorcycle, vehicle crash">&larr;
