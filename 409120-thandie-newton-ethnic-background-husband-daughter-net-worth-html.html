She has starred in several films such as<i> Mission Impossible 2</i>, <i>Crash</i>, <i>For Coloured Girls</i>, and <i>Beloved</i>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec98272d5bba4e3f.jpg><p class=align-left>Who is Thandie Newton – the woman, not just the actress? While she is a household name in the entertainment industry, there is more to her than just acting. Here is more about her childhood to her ethnicity, royalty roots, family, career, and net worth.</p><h2>Thandie Newton profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Name: </strong>Melanie Thandiwe Newton</li><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>November 6, 1972 (48 years)</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> London, United Kingdom</li><li><strong>Education: </strong>Downing College, Cambridge</li><li><strong>Profession: </strong>Actress</li><li><strong>Husband: </strong>Oliver Ol Parker (married 1998 - present)</li></ul><h2>Early life</h2><p class=align-left>Thandie Newton (real Melanie Thandiwe Newton) was born on November 6, 1972, in London, United Kingdom. There had been rumours that her birthplace is in Zambia. However, this is not true; her parents lived and worked in Zambia but visited London.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thandie Newton is of Zimbabwean and British ancestry. Her mother is of Shona ethnicity - one of the largest ethnic tribes in Zimbabwe – while her father is of British descent.</p><p class=align-left>Thandie spent three years as a child in Zambia, where her parents worked in the healthcare sector. However, her parents would later move back to England – with her father taking up the family business. She then spent the rest of her childhood in Penzance, Cornwall.</p><p class=align-left>Thandie Newton attended St. Mary’s Roman Catholic school and later a private school – The School of Claire – in Penzance. She has admitted to feeling out of place while growing up, especially while attending catholic school. To start with, she was a black girl with African roots attending an all-white school. She was also an atheist in a Catholic school operated by nuns.</p><p class=align-left>Growing up in Penzance was not easy for Thandie, despite the beautiful environment. She was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">victim of racial abuse</a> by bullies – the town was primarily white in racial composition. She also faced a lot of pressure to fit in. For example, her name Thandiwe – an African name meaning 'beloved' - was 'whitewashed' to a more <a href=#>western</a> version – Thandie. It is only recently that she has reclaimed her real name.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/98cdd5cfdcf4cbee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie McGrath: height, sexuality, spouse, heterochromia, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While growing up, Thandiwe attended Tring School for the Performing Arts, where she studied dance. Later, after finishing her secondary education, she enrolled at Downing College in Cambridge. In 1995, she graduated with a Social Anthropology degree from the institution.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Thandiwe started her career in the film industry in 1991, with her debut role in the movie Flirting. She would later land another role in 1994, acting alongside Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the film Interview with the Vampire. However, her breakthrough came in 1995 when she played the role of Sally Hemings in Jefferson’s film in Paris.</p><p class=align-left>Following her Jefferson in Paris role, Thandie was cast in the filmed Beloved as a titular character. She played alongside other top stars – <a href=#>Danny</a> Glover and Oprah Winfrey. Later, she would land another role in Mission Impossible 2 and several other films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Aside from the big screen, Thandie Newton also landed roles in television shows.
