Landslides carrying millions of tons of rock, rubble and soil down a slope can reach speeds of 100mph but they leave the grass beneath them completely untouched. This is because air, trapped and compressed, acts as a cushion, allowing the moving debris to travel several centimetres above the ground.</span></p><h2><span>Q2 LUNAR</span></h2><img id=i-d88d95c235490d5c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/18/article-2760068-2176545900000578-35_306x390.jpg height=390 width=306 alt="Buzz Aldrin was the second man to walk on the moon, but what was he the first man to do there?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Buzz Aldrin was the second man to walk on the moon, but what was he the first man to do there?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Buzz Aldrin was the second man to walk on the moon, but what was he the first man to do there?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Throw a baseball.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Play golf.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Receive Holy Communion.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Moonwalk.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-weight:700;font-style:italic><span>Answer: c). While still in the lunar module, Aldrin ate and drank a special home-made Communion kit that he had brought with him (as there were no clergy on the Moon, his church had given him permission to administer it to himself).</span></span></p><h2><span>Q3 LIQUID</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The most expensive commonly used liquid in the world is perfume. What’s the second most expensive?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Liquid nitrogen.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Computer printer ink.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Vintage champagne.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Human blood.</span><br><span>Answer: b). Brand-name printer ink costs about half as much as perfume by volume and about seven times as much as Dom Perignon 1985 vintage champagne. It has been estimated that to fill an Olympic-size pool with printer ink would cost about £4.3 billion.</span></p><h2><span>Q4 LONDON</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Which one of these has the London Underground never been used for?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) A hostel for poor tourists.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) A fighter plane factory.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) A submariners’ training college.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span><span style=font-weight:700>d) A deep-level vegetable farm</span>.</span><br><span style=font-weight:700;font-style:italic><span>Answer: c). In 1951, tourists visiting for the Festival of Britain were put up in the shelter below Clapham South – the same place where Caribbean immigrants had been temporarily housed in 1948. In World War II, the Central line was converted into a fighter aircraft factory that stretched for more than two miles, with its own miniature railway system. And in 2014 a company bought the shelter at Clapham North so it could be used to grow vegetables with artificial light.</span></span></p><h2><span>Q5 LACROSSE</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What was lacrosse traditionally called by Native Americans?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) The little brother of war.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) The older sister of hunting.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) The grandfather of sports.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) The second cousin of fishing.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>&nbsp;miles apart – meaning games could go on for days.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-weight:700;font-style:italic><span>Answer: a). Lacrosse is a traditional Native American game. One of its first names was ‘tewaarathon’, meaning ‘the little brother of war’ – supposedly because of the endurance and aggression it developed in its players. It was very violent – one of the players’ primary duties was to disable the opposing team before even trying to score a goal. As with traditional English football, teams could have hundreds of players, and the goals were miles apart – meaning games could go on for days.</span></span></p><h2><span>Q6 LAUGHING</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Franz Hals’ The Laughing Cavalier portrait seems to find something hilarious – so what’s he on?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Cannabis.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Nitrous oxide.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Geneva gin.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Nothing – he’s laughing at the painter’s silly little moustache.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: a). The painting is on canvas, which is woven from hemp, the Greek for which is kannabis, from which we get both the English word ‘cannabis’ and the word ‘canvas’. The title of the painting is a Victorian invention: when the Marquess of Hertford bought it in 1865 it was simply called ‘Portrait Of A Man’. The top right-hand corner of the picture gives the man’s age as 26, but he’s not a cavalier and he’s not really laughing either.</span></p><img id=i-23f629b5379fbe15 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/18/article-2760068-2176539E00000578-85_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Which of these animals can be trained to guard sheep? a) Llamas; b) Leopards; c) Lemurs; d) Lions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Which of these animals can be trained to guard sheep? a) Llamas; b) Leopards; c) Lemurs; d) Lions</p><h2><span>Q7 L-ANIMALS</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Which of these animals can be trained to guard sheep?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Llamas.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Leopards.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Lemurs.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Lions.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: a). Llamas can be used to guard sheep. More than half the owners of ‘guard llamas’ – as they are known – said they had completely eliminated the loss of sheep to predators.</span></p><h2><span>Q8 LANGUAGE</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What’s Quite Interesting about the Cornish language?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) It’s only six years old.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) It has no word for ‘blue’.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Nature-loving presenter David Attenborough speaks it fluently.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) It is spookily similar to Swahili.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: a). Cornish is a very old language but fell out of use for many years. However, it made a comeback in the 20th century and, in 2008, a standard written version of the language was put together. Because of the long&nbsp; gap, it’s not identical to old Cornish, but it’s very close. The Cornish for ‘how’ is ‘ass’ and the Cornish for ‘bin’ is ‘argh’. The first Cornish-speaking crèche opened in 2010.</span></p><h2><span>Q9 LAKES</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What happens if you put silver in a lake?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) The silver goes black.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) The water goes green.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) The water cleans the silver.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) The silver cleans the water.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: d). Silver has the extraordinary ability to sterilise water. You can add silver salts to swimming pools instead of chlorine and you need a surprisingly tiny amount – about ten parts per billion. This remarkable property of silver was known to the ancient Persians from at least the fourth century BC and may explain why silver coins are often found at the bottom of wells.</span></p><h2><span>Q10 LEWIS CARROLL</span></h2><img id=i-74b2f9f1ed82ff14 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/18/article-2760068-21771BAC00000578-160_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Lewis Carroll wrote many books but he was also a superb inventor. What did he invent?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lewis Carroll wrote many books but he was also a superb inventor. What did he invent?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lewis Carroll wrote many books but he was also a superb inventor. What did he invent?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) A gas-fired toothbrush.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) A pair of wheeled slippers.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) A hat that combed your hair.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) An alarm clock that threw you out of bed.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: d). Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Dodgson (1832-1898), an Oxford mathematics lecturer. He designed ‘The Alarm Clock Bed’, which featured in the Great Exhibition of 1851. It woke occupants by tipping them out at a set time. His other inventions included a device for writing down thoughts at night without getting out of bed and an early form of the game Scrabble.</span></p><h2><span>Q11 LANGUEYEURS</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In France in the Middle Ages, what did the men known as langueyeurs de porc do?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Lounge around public parks on Sundays to encourage people to take a rest.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Examine pigs’ tongues to see if they showed signs of illness.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Exorcise farm animals – especially pigs – to get devils out of them.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Stretch out bacon to give the impression that cuts of meat were larger than they really were.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: b). Langueyeurs de porc were responsible for ensuring that food standards were maintained – the constant risk of epidemics required strict rules. Butchers in Poitiers had to prove that they weren’t scrofulous and hadn’t been excommunicated. The rules stayed strict for centuries; in Maine during the 18th century, it was illegal to sell beef from a market stall unless two independent witnesses could testify they’d seen the cow in question brought in alive.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Q12 LITERATURE</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Apart from the obvious, what did JM Barrie,&nbsp; HG Wells, Arthur Conan&nbsp; Doyle, PG Wodehouse and&nbsp; AA Milne have in common?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) They were all members of the same séance club.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) They all played the female lead in a school play.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) They all played for the same cricket team.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) They were all engaged to the same woman (at different times).</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: c). JM Barrie’s love of cricket led him to found his own all-star club, the Allahakbarries, in 1887. It contained famous writers, explorers and dignitaries. Other players included Jerome K Jerome, GK Chesterton and AEW Mason. Barrie printed a booklet of advice for the team in 1893, including tips such as, ‘Don’t practise on opponent’s ground before match begins. This can only give them confidence’ and, ‘Should you hit the ball, run at once. Don’t stop to cheer’.</span></p><h2><span>Q13 LADYBIRDS</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Which of these is not a traditional nickname for ladybirds?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) The Keys Of Heaven.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) The Devil’s Chickens.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Saint John’s Pimples.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) The Cows of Moses.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: c). Ladybirds have had a huge range of nicknames over the years. ‘The Keys of Heaven’ is a traditional English name for them. One Italian species is nicknamed ‘The Devil’s Chickens’, in Hebrew they’re known as the ‘Cows of Moses’ and in Cherokee they’re even called the ‘Great Beloved Woman’. The ‘ladybird’ name comes from the fact that in medieval times their spots reminded people of the Virgin Mary’s red cloak. As a result, they were called ‘Our Lady’s Bird’.</span></p><h2><span>Q14 LAST SUPPER<br></span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Who or what did most damage to Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Enraged monks.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Napoleon’s troops.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) The Royal Air Force.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Leonardo da Vinci himself.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: d). The painting started to deteriorate almost as soon as Leonardo finished it. Ever the innovator, da Vinci had ignored tried and tested fresco techniques and used&nbsp; the wrong paints on the wrong surface, meaning it decayed quickly. Centuries later, Napoleon’s soldiers supposedly tied their horses to the convent wall&nbsp; it was painted on, and the building’s&nbsp; roof was torn off by a bomb in&nbsp; World War II, so it was exposed to the elements for three years.</span></p><h2><span>Q15LULLY-PRIGGING</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What was involved in the historical fashion crime of ‘lully-prigging’?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Stealing ladies’ handbags by cutting the strings.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Stealing laundry off washing lines.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Cross-dressing in a church precinct.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Knocking off policemen’s helmets with malice aforethought.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span><span style=font-weight:700>Answer: b). ‘Lully-prigging’ was stealing clothes from washing lines when they’d been put out to dry. This wasn’t the only Victorian crime with a good name:&nbsp; a ‘lush-toucher’ was someone who robbed drunk people, while a ‘lumper’ was someone who stole goods from ships. A ‘low gagger’, on the other hand, was someone who elicited money&nbsp; from strangers by pretending to have suffered hardships.</span></span></p><h2><span>Q16 LOBSTER</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Who was the mysterious man known as Thomas Lobster?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) The Dutch scientist who first displayed a lobster at the Royal Society.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) An average 18th-century British soldier.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Thomas ‘Lobster’ Claus, a gangster who always dressed in red.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) ‘The Lobster’, a 19th-century tennis champion famous for his lobs.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: b). The best-known name for the typical British soldier is ‘Tommy Atkins’, but before that he was known as ‘Thomas Lobster’ because of the red military coats English soldiers wore. Tommy Atkins was used as early as 1743 – there’s a myth that the Duke of Wellington came up with it – and for decades specimen forms for enlisting soldiers were filled in by a fictional ‘Tommy Atkins’. During World War I, many British troops hated the name and they only used&nbsp; it derisively.</span></p><h2><span>Q17 LUCK</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>How did Robert Mugabe get lucky in 2000?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) He won a Zimbabwe-wide singing contest.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) He won the Zimbabwean National Lottery.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) He won a crossword competition in the Harare Herald.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) He was voted Most Handsome Man In Zimbabwe.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: b). With almost implausibly good fortune, Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, hit 100,000 Zimbabwean dollars (then worth about £2,600) on the lottery in 2000. The stroke of luck came the year after Mugabe had awarded himself and his cabinet pay rises of up to 200 per cent.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Q18 LIECHTENSTEIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What is Quite Interesting about Lichtenstein’s army?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) It’s never lost a battle.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) It’s never won a battle.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) It’s never fought a battle.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) It doesn’t exist.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: d). The last time Liechtenstein’s army fought was in 1866. It only consisted of 80 men then, but 80 was evidently too many and in 1868, the army was abolished and the country declared itself permanently neutral. Liechtenstein was last invaded in 2007, when a company of 170 Swiss soldiers accidentally crossed a mile over the border at night and then retreated after realising their mistake. Nobody in Liechtenstein noticed their error.</span></p><h2><span>Q19 LEXICOGRAPHY<br></span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Why did Samuel Johnson leave ‘cutlet’ out of his dictionary?</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>a) Because he forgot it.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>b) Because it hadn’t yet been invented.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>c) Because the word was French and therefore untrustworthy.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>d) Because he nearly choked on a cutlet while writing the ‘C’ section.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Answer: c). Johnson mistrusted French words, so the words ‘champagne’ and ‘bourgeois’ didn’t get in either. Strangely, he didn’t mind including the word ‘escargatoire’, which he defined as ‘a nursery of snails’.
