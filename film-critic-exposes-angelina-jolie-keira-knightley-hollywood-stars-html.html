There’s one exception: for 35 years, British critic David Thomson, ­Editor of The Biographical Dictionary Of Film, ­has been compiling compellingly unvarnished critiques of the stars. In the latest edition, this is how he describes the new entries...</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><br></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>KEIRA KNIGHTLEY:</span> She is ­astonishingly beautiful. But Keira is about as interesting as a creme brulée where too much refrigeration has killed flavour with ice burn. She is still more credible as a faintly animated photographer’s model than as an actress.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>JOHN CLEESE: </span>He works very hard ­nowadays, but the grim truth sinks deeper — this great man is no longer funny.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>JULIE CHRISTIE: </span>She is, sadly, obvious in her efforts, lacking in either gaiety or insight and, most serious of all, gawky, self-conscious and lantern-jawed.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>ANGELINA JOLIE: </span>No one writing about Angelina’s arrival on screen in the late Nineties could mask sheer wonder at the carnal embouchure that is her mouth. It could blind anyone.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>HUGH GRANT:</span> With his drooping chin and pouty lips, his quaff of hair and dithery manner, Hugh Grant seems like a refugee from Thirties theatre — or an incipient sneeze looking for a vacant nose.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/30/article-1342604-0C9AECB9000005DC-831_233x548.jpg height=548 width=233 alt="Richard Gere has been in enough bad films to make one think his career was drawing to a close" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Richard Gere has been in enough bad films to make one think his career was drawing to a close</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>RICHARD GERE:</span> He has been in enough bad films to make one think his career was drawing to a close - he is generally more interesting when doing less.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>BILL NIGHY:</span> Somewhere between a scarecrow and a faded aristocrat.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>CATE BLANCHETT: </span>Something is not quite clicking. She was prone and unconscious for most of Babel; implausible in Notes On A Scandal; again in Elizabeth: The Golden Age; unbelievable and undesirable in The Curious Case Of ­Benjamin Button. Enough?<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>SIR MICHAEL CAINE:</span> He tends to be as cold and barricaded in as his spectacles.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>MERYL STREEP: </span>She has problems now with seeming natural.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>DEMI MOORE:</span> She has no dramatic sense. At present, it is not quite clear if she is active, resting, or just out of it.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>JAMIE LEE CURTIS:</span> She works steadily, usually in ­family comedies or the obligatory horror films (which also fit her increasingly haunted look — or is that just keeping in such tip-top condition for so long?).<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>TOM CRUISE:</span> There are those who view Tom Cruise as the representative of all that is immature in American cinema today — the cockiness, the grin, the huge box-office ­success and the sudden falls from grace. In that spirit, Cruise is the worst of the spoilt brats of Hollywood — because he has been the most successful.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>HUGH JACKMAN:</span> He is hot (I suppose). Now, he just needs to be interesting.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>BEN AFFLECK: </span>On one hand I have always had a soft spot for Affleck. But my other view is that he is boring, ­complacent and criminally lucky to have got away with everything so far.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=# class=external><span><i></i>Browse our choice of DVDs with MailLife.co.uk</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p><span style=font-weight:700>BRAD PITT:</span> Hardly anything he touches now is less than ‘precious’ and ‘awesome’ — it can’t be long before he begins to look very tired.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>JENNIFER ANISTON:</span> She’s in her 40s now and her £5 ­million-a-movie career ­cannot go on for much longer. But rather in the manner of Doris Day, while one can make gentle fun of Jennifer Aniston, it’s hard to dislike her.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/30/article-1342604-0C9AEF33000005DC-316_233x546.jpg height=546 width=233 alt="Rachel Weisz is unwilling to do anything to mask her Jewishness - including putting a damper on her vigorous intellect" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Rachel Weisz is unwilling to do anything to mask her Jewishness - including putting a damper on her vigorous intellect</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>RACHEL WEISZ: </span>Yes, she's Jewish and unwilling to do anything to mask it - including putting a damper on her vigorous intellect.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>STEVE MARTIN: </span>He seems fundamentally averse to acting.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>SANDRA BULLOCK:</span> She has become a business, a ­production company and what is called a national favourite. So be it — but, as I go through the list of her films, I defy you to be quite sure which film was which.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>HILARY SWANK:</span> In nearly everything she has done, she has been pretty, dull,<br>ordinary and incapable of lifting the film clear of a sanctimonious mud.</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>GWYNETH PALTROW: </span>Awarding her an Oscar for her performance in Shakespeare In Love was too generous.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>MICHELLE PFEIFFER:</span> She still carries the rather stunned, obedient air of a checkout girl at the supermarket, as well as the lustre of a beauty ­pageant winner.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>LEONARDO DiCAPRIO:</span> Now that he is past 35 and beginning to look a touch puffy, there are those ready to dismiss DiCaprio. We’ll see how much creative stamina he possesses, but I fear that kind of fey magic he once had has slipped from his face.</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>GERARD DEPARDIEU:</span> ­Depardieu has the air of a rugby player (after a game played in heavy mud) crossed with a great violinist. But am I alone in feeling that I’ve seen his every mood and urge over and over again?<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>HARRISON FORD: </span>There may not be an actor in the ­history of movies whose films have grossed more money. But on the few occasions of ­adventurousness in his career, he has revealed himself as a limited, anxious actor.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/30/article-1342604-0C9AED89000005DC-216_233x530.jpg height=530 width=233 alt="Drew Barrymore was born so recently (in 1975), and yet seems to have been here, and a problem, for so long" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Drew Barrymore was born so recently (in 1975), and yet seems to have been here, and a problem, for so long</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>DREW BARRYMORE: </span>I can't help finding it shocking, as well as startling, that Drew Barrymore was born so recently (in 1975), and yet seems to have been here, and a problem, for so long.</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>GEORGE CLOONEY:</span> It’s clear, as he approaches 50, that George Clooney is the most liked actor in U.S. ­pictures. And it is also clear that he knows it.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>MATT DAMON: </span>What’s most interesting about Damon is the very lack of good looks — and the feeling of a squashed and rebuilt face.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>BRUCE WILLIS:</span> The ­mystery continues. Willis makes ­quantities of commercial junk, where his raised eyebrows soar into the space left by his ­receding hairline. And then he produces something that unmistakably reveals a tender, wise actor.<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>NICOLAS CAGE: </span>It has to be said that the Cage of the past few years has been distressingly fixed on money-making movies of questionable worth. If he doesn’t have enough money yet to settle for taking a risk, then what is the point of money?<br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700>RALPH FIENNES: </span>There are those who find him beautiful, classy and intellectual. Others remark on the extraordinary opportunities he has had, ­coupled with his strange ­reticence to expose himself — I mean his spirit, for he takes his clothes off regularly. He sometimes acts as if he would rather be offscreen.</p><p><span style=font-weight:700>CATHERINE ZETA-JONES: </span>The ‘Zeta’ in her name (a shrewd move) does suggest some Latin blood that would match her extreme, ripe, dark good looks. But, in truth, it was her grandmother’s name — and if one knows Wales at all, there is a very Welsh look to Jones — a kind of Polly Garter flash, full of flirt, anger, and sauce. In the real valleys, it must be said, it is a prettiness that tends to fade early.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/30/article-1342604-0C09CB40000005DC-168_87x84.jpg height=84 width=87 alt="Writer David Thomson" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption></p><p><span style=font-style:italic>Extracted from The New Biographical Dictionary Of Film by David Thomson (pictured right), published by Little, Brown at £35. © David Thomson 2010.<br></span></p><p><span style=font-style:italic>To order a copy at £31.50 (p&p free), call 0845 155 0720</span>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2SbWlvaGRkk6q4zGaaq6GknrBusdeppqydo2KOr7PEpaCnmV1%2FvK21xGaCnqGilnqMusign62kla56ibvLpbCwp5%2BZerTAwKuqZ6Ckork%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./grace-kelly-granddaughter-charlotte-casiraghi-dimitri-rassam-engaged-156822.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grace Kellys Granddaughter Charlotte Casiraghi and Dimitri Rassam Are Engaged!
