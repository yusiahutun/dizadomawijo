bus which was turned into Santa’s grotto and driven on to London’s South Bank on Saturday.</p><p>The previous evening he had also sung the tune on TV’s The One Show as he launched his full charm offensive.</p><p>But&nbsp;Wham!’s team has also upped the ante by re-releasing Last Christmas on vinyl.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo are loads of sales in front of <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> at No3 with All I Want For Christmas Is You.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being an early favourite at the bookies, Creator Universe, a group of British TikTok stars, are only at No11 with I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday.</p><p>Although there were hopes the Pogues would top the charts with Fairytale Of New York following frontman Shane MacGowan's death last month, it is at No5 according to the latest figures.</p><p>Noah Kahan’s Stick Season and Jack Harlow's Lovin On Me are the only non-festive hits in the Top 20.</p><p>Sam said on Saturday: “Imagine blasting through the <span

working out and not being as crazy and focused on other things and trying to stay down a clean path.”</p><p>But don’t think that means 2024 will be quiet for Rita, because she will be working on her fourth album in January.</p><p>She explained: “I am really excited.&nbsp;I just want to keep going now.&nbsp;I don’t want to stop.</p><p>“I am doing a couple of films <span
