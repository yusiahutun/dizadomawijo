of Comic Relief in 2003 before he moved on from the channel in 2005.</p><p>Since then, the 43-year-old star threw himself into his passion for sport as a sports presenter after he was hired as a match reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live.</p><p>It was at this point that the star's career really took off where he went on to cover many legendary sporting events including the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Australia, the 2006 Ashes and the 2007 Cricket World Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

to report on his passion on an episode of Newsround in the hours after his death hit the headlines.</p><p>Since his death, the star created a 2009 documentary for BBC Three titled Kirsten’s Topless Ambition where the starlet debated whether or not to strip off for a modelling gig with a lads mag.</p><p>She explained how she faced a huge decision – whether to do what many other female presenters had done before her and take her clothes off for a lads’ mag to try and clinch bigger, better presenting jobs and a more adult audience.</p><p>Despite the numerous offers she had, the blonde belle decided against it and went on to appear in a slew of TV competitions including Celebrity MasterChef, Let’s Dance For Sport Relief and Big Brother’s Bit on the Side.</p><h3>Angellica Bell & Michael
