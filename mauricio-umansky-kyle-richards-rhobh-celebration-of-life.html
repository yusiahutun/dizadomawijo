I did many times but then I guess I need to again," she wrote Thursday on her Instagram Story. "Moe offered to cancel his trip multiple times. Even though there were many people involved in this trip. I told him he did not need to do that. The date of the event was changed last minute and none of the other men were attending."</p><p>"I had a lot of support around me that night. It's not fair to put that on him," she concluded.</p><p>The post included a clip from the RHOBH after-show, in which Sutton said, "The family is there and so this has got to be hard on Kyle and you want your husband with you. Kyle, where was Mauricio?"</p><p>The clip also included more of a defense from Kyle, who said her estranged other half "loved Lorene and she loved him so much."</p><p>"The date that we chose, he had something already organized and our schedules of lately have not been in sync. So, it's been hard enough as it is," Richards continued. "I didn't want to hear about that. I didn't want him to feel bad hearing that on camera when it genuinely was not his fault as all. He would have been there for her and for me."</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story below</p><p>The cracks in <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mauricio Umansky's</strong></a> marriage continue to show on the current season of <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong></a>.</p><p>Wednesday's new hour began with costar Sutton Stracke questioning Mo's behavior, after he failed to show up to a celebration of life his wife held for her best friend since childhood, Lorene Shea, on the first anniversary of her death. Lorene died by suicide in May 2022.</p><p>"Where was Mo?" Stracke asked after Kyle came to her home in the days after the event.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:27152339-7688-40ec-849b-4abe79d738ac data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c1e2062-0055-4f1a-83dd-485e1c544d47 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e1/5by4/2024/01/12/e1868b186df7492896a87dea63f5cda1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Celebrates 55th Birthday with Morgan Wade amid Mauricio Umansky Separation</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"He was in Mexico City. He was in Aspen and then Mexico City. He went to Aspen and then flew on his friend's plane to Mexico City," she said, adding that he would be back home in time for an event Dorit Kemsley was throwing for the Homeless Not Toothless charity.</p><p>"I'm not accepting the excuse Mo is giving," Sutton said in a confessional, "Unless you're in the hospital or dead in a ditch, you show up for your wife and your wife's dead best friend's family."</p><p>Later in the episode, she added, "Alright, Mauricio, you can come to the Homeless Not Toothless event, but you can't come to the celebration of life event for your wife? That's messed up."</p><p>In the car on the way to the event, Mauricio asked his wife how her event went, with Kyle explaining that she hoped people would enjoy themselves while also honoring Lorene and addressing the serious subject of mental health. Mo then made sure he wasn't the only husband who didn't attend, asking, "None of the guys went, right?"</p><p>While that was true, Kyle appeared a little disappointed in a confessional he wasn't there.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:31392755-3b5a-4271-a16f-9d798a781214 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c1e2062-0055-4f1a-83dd-485e1c544d47 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ce/5by4/2024/01/11/ce65600cf77c484facb2ccdaaca2e7b0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Says She Had a Fight with Mauricio Umansky Over Social Media Messages with Other Women</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Would it have meant something to me if all of a sudden, he showed up at the event for Lorene? Of course it would have. He was close with her also," she said, as video footage showed her comforting one of Lorene's family members at the event who asked whether Mauricio was there.</p><p>The pair also addressed their very busy schedules while on the drive to the charity event, as Mo commented on how much he's been traveling lately. It was then Kyle surprised him by revealing she had a whole trip to Spain planned which he knew nothing about.</p><p>"It's a little taste of his own medicine, to be honest, because there are many times where all of a sudden he's like, I'm off to Portugal, I don't really get a heads up," Kyle remarked in a confessional. "So, oops."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fc8de6f6-af8e-4e19-9833-7b352dbfa6d1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c1e2062-0055-4f1a-83dd-485e1c544d47 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e0/5by4/2023/12/28/e0b406e14e984925bf99d5a01770b713_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Shares Update on Weight Loss & Marriage After Spending Holidays with Mauricio Umansky</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Once at the event, Kyle commented on how awkward some of the red carpets can be -- as speculation continued in the press about their relationship.</p><p>"I feel like every time I go to one of these events, there's a lot of whispering and watching Mauricio and me. Which feels really strange," she explained. "They're analyzing every move and hand gesture. It's very weird."</p><p>Richards and Umansky confirmed their separation in October following months of rumors, but continue to live under the same roof. Kyle recently celebrated her 55th birthday in Mexico, but Mauricio wasn't anywhere in sight.</p><p>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays on Bravo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:317f7638-664e-486c-b644-0469b64faa92 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c1e2062-0055-4f1a-83dd-485e1c544d47 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4f/5by4/2023/12/13/4fec8262584a4f9899229211df50ec76_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Breaks Down Over Marriage Issues, Best Friend's Suicide and Kathy Hilton Feud on RHOBH</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmam9foq62vsicoKhlpaKur7%2FKsmSksZyaerO1wqGYq5yjYr%2Bpu8GhZJydnJqvs63ToqanZZ%2Bbeq21xZ5m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./north-korea-marks-war-anniversary-rallies-vowing-revenge-against-us.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="North Korea vows revenge against US in rallies marking war anniversary">&larr;
