A fixed water sign, Scorpio’s raw passion has the power to penetrate beyond the surface. Its Plutonian sorcery is a catalyst for alchemy and creation, but surrender is the key to your transformation.</p><p>Can you feel the intensity brewing faster than your body can keep up? If you know <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>which astrological house</a> belongs to Scorpio in your birth chart, you could feel tensions rising in this area of life, especially with the sun, Mercury, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mars adding fuel to the fire</a>. Be sure to tune into the deeper octaves of your most uncomfortable emotions and gain clarity from a visit with your shadow self. The parts of you that prefer to hide in the shadows are coming up to the surface. Eclipse season is now officially behind you and a new lunar cycle is beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 13—at exactly 4:27 a.m. ET—the moon will renew itself via 20 degrees of this fixed water sign. During this lunar phase, the sun <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>joins forces with the moon</a>, and the sky is at its darkest. However, the moon’s lack of visibility should never be underestimated, as it marks a time for magic, fertility and new beginnings. The darkness surrounding this lunar phase feels eerie, edgy, and unpredictable, but that’s an understatement when it comes of Scorpio’s heavy-handedness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-26.png><p>Sitting just two degrees away from Mars in Scorpio—right where the red planet is in its home zodiac sign, not to mention a force to be reckoned with—this lunation is highly charged and even still, that’s putting it lightly. Mars is aggressive, triggering, and audacious in its desire to charge ahead. While there are powerful activations occurring at this time, the way you harness this intense energy is key.&nbsp;</p><p>What are you looking to transform <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>and essentially conquer in your life</a>? With Mars conjunct the new moon, you not only have the courage and strength to face something head-on, but also the passion and focus to get it done. On a more rebellious note, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the sun, moon and Mars</a> will be making an opposition to electric Uranus, the planet of breakthroughs and unexpected change.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The new moon in Scorpio takes place on November 13 at 4:27 a.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Keep in mind, Scorpio’s fixed waters can be equally as consistent as they are stubborn and ready to take the gloves off. That said, if you’ve been repressing your emotions about something in particular, or unconsciously denying a part of yourself, this new moon in Scorpio can ultimately set you free. Otherwise, be sure to steer away from environments and situations that don’t feel safe.</p><p>Don’t get it twisted—confronting your fears and shadowy attributes is essential to your growth <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>under this new moon in Scorpio</a>. However, it’s important to note that the influence of erratic Uranus can be both disruptive and volatile. Stay centered and resilient through the way you take care of yourself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-new-moon-in-scorpio-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How the New Moon in Scorpio Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming new moon in Scorpio, according to your <a href=#>sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3572216097023><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Although Mars—your celestial ruler—is a formidable adversary when transiting the sign of Scorpio, its close proximity to the new moon and its opposition to freedom-loving Uranus could be especially triggering for you.
