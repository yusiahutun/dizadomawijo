The three brothers, Larenz Tate, Larron, and Lahmard Tate, have produced, directed, and even acted in numerous Hollywood movies. Time and again, these brothers hit the social waves because of their professional and personal lives.</p><p>The brothers’ die-hard fans have always been urged to know about their private persona, and we assure you we will get that covered for you, not to mention the questions about their brotherhood.</p><p>This article will confirm whether the Tate brothers are triplets or not. Also, you will be comparing the three brothers’ biographies.</p><h2><strong>Are Larenz Tate, Larron Tate, and Lahmard Tate Triplets?</strong></h2><p>The famous Tate brothers are often mistaken to be triplets by their fans because of their stunningly similar looks. However, <strong>they are not triplets, and this can be easily verified with the help of their totally different birthdates.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Out of the three brothers, Larron is the eldest one, followed by Lahmard in the second, and Larenz is the junior one. And yes, they are neither twins nor triplets, but they do share the brotherhood like one.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-6333 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Larenz-Tate-Larron-Tate-and-Lahmard-Tate-Triplets-Facts.jpg alt="Larenz Tate with his siblings, Larron Tate and Lahmard Tate" width=600 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-6333 class=wp-caption-text>Larenz Tate with his siblings, Larron Tate and Lahmard Tate</p><h2><strong>Parents</strong></h2><p>The three brothers belong to the same family and are not from different parents.

At that time, their kids were all below ten years.</p><p>As the couple migrated to California, they helped their sons begin their acting career by encouraging them to join acting classes from their early teens. The parents enrolled three brothers in Inner City Cultural Center, where they continued on the way to Hollywood.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-6334 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Larenz-Tate-Parents.jpg alt="Larenz Tate with his parents, Larry Tate and Peggy Tate" width=622 height=461 sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-6334 class=wp-caption-text>Larenz Tate smiling with his parents, Larry Tate and Peggy Tate</p><h2><strong>Larenz Tate Net Worth, Age, Bio</strong></h2><p>Of the three, <a href=#>Larenz</a> is the youngest sibling in the Tate family.
