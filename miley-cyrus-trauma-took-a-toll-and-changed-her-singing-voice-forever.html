From attempting to pull away from the change in how her voice sounds, to trying to change her <a href=#>Disney</a> Channel image, her life in the spotlight has been difficult.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1239536912-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-change-in-her-voice>A change in her voice</h2><p>Miley has been subjected in recent years to a lot of speculation about why her voice, both when she speaks and sings, suddenly changed. The Party in the USA songstress has now cleared up the confusion.</p><p>The <a href=#>TV</a> actress said that she’d had surgery after being diagnosed with Reinke’s edema, which causes swelling underneath the surface of the vocal cords. This means that the person’s voice will sound different as their cords cannot vibrate in the same way, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">University of Pittsburgh</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Bruce Willis’ daughter ‘misses her papa’ but has moments she’ll ‘treasure for the rest of her life’</a></strong></p><p>She explained on Joe Rogan’s podcast that she smoked and drank a lot but no longer does either after she “learned so much about the effects.”</p><p>“I don’t smoke anymore and I’m sober. The vocal surgery kind of did it for me,” she said, “because I just learned so much about the effects. You’re just not taught it’s not really the drinking, it’s the staying up all night. Once you have your drink, you end up smoking.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> praised her surgery, adding, “It was a gift, because I was able to understand my instrument. No one ever explained that to me. I sat in a room with a piano and did scales&nbsp;… but no one taught me about how you have longevity.”</p><p>Miley Cyrus also said that the fire that tore through her Malibu home with ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in 2018 caused her voice to “change a lot.”</p><p>“It’s coming out in a whole other way. I honestly feel like my voice changed a lot after the fire. I could sing better after the fire in some way. It’s almost&nbsp;like it unleashed something. I noticed my voice got better as I had trauma.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth>Her divorce from Liam Hemsworth</h2><p>Miley and Liam had an on-again, off-again relationship for about a decade, starting when they starred in the film The Last Song in 2010. After some turbulence in their relationship, the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> got married in 2018.</p><p>The union, however, was short-lived. Liam, 33, filed for divorce in August 2019 and their divorce was finalized in 2020.</p><p>Speaking about their split on the same podcast episode, Miley,<a href=#> whose photo with Taylor Swift “clearly showed” she was bisexual</a>, said that “f***ing sucked.”</p><p>“What really sucked about it wasn’t the fact that me and someone that I loved realized that we don’t love each other the way that we used to anymore,” she added. “That’s OK, I can accept that. I can’t accept the villainizing, and just all those stories.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-s-sister-labels-her-disrespectful>Miley’s sister labels her ‘disrespectful’</h2><p>Elsewhere in the podcast, Miley discussed her famous family and spoke about her younger sister Noah, saying that, although the 23-year-old loves making music, she doesn’t like being in the spotlight. But it was what she said about her sibling’s music that hit a nerve, and<a href=#> she was called “disrespectful” by Noah</a>.</p><p>She told Joe: “She’s got a record out that I love called The End of Everything … and it’s the most depressing EP you’ll ever listen to.</p><p>“She has a song where she says, ‘My sister’s like sunshine / It’ll follow her wherever she goes / But I’m more like a rain cloud.’ You know, it’s like, she’s really got this idea of me.”</p><p>After the episode was released, Noah commented on a TikTok clip containing Miley’s comments and wrote: “The disrespect in this video…”</p><p>It’s not clear if it was a joke or the start of some real drama, but Noah didn’t attend their mom’s wedding to her new husband earlier this year, while Miley didn’t attend her dad’s but Noah did.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Hugh Jackman fans suspect he’s looking for love after spotting ‘sign’</a></strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eAcLnIpZyyZZOuv7a%2FjK2pmq2dlnq1u86kZJplpKS5rXnAp5tmm5iWu6ixw2afnqpdqLavs8innmaun56wpnnFqKmerpWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./6066e481e2704e3f9e8b4626-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Motos: Silence: el fenmeno de las motos elctricas que triunfa en Europa">&larr;
