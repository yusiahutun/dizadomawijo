He was born in the early 1930s, which means he will be in his 80s in 2022. Robert attended a local <a href=#>high school</a> where he attained his secondary school <a href=#>education</a>. Later, he went to a tertiary learning institution and advanced his studies.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Join</a> TUKO.co.ke Telegram channel! Never miss important updates</strong></p><p class=align-left>Robert is reportedly from Europe but holds a Swiss-German nationality and is of white ethnicity. He came to live and work in South Africa in the 1980s, which was a period when apartheid rule was in full swing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1fb7d1b158574e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brandon Teena's story: Background, what happened, and documentaries</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is known that Robert didn’t like the apartheid law and was not in tune with the political situation in South Africa. He hated the regime that implemented apartheid and didn't understand why the whites oppressed the black South Africans in their country. Robert was compassionate towards black South Africans and did a lot of activities to help them.</p><h2>How did Trevor Noah’s father meet Trevor’s mother?</h2><p class=align-left>Trevor Noah met Patricia in Johannesburg. During this time, Robert was a <a href=#>professional chef</a>. He had an excellent reputation in New York and Canada and owned a restaurant in Johannesburg, South Africa. He employed black South Africans as members of his kitchen.</p><p class=align-left>Robert travelled a lot. His restaurant allowed South Africans, black and white, to integrate. The restaurant was allowed to operate under a special license, distributed by the government out of necessity. However, few people were happy about the <a href=#>restaurant’s idea</a> and wanted to bring it down via several petitions. They stated unhealthy practices and environmental violations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a1c83012c4c607.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Percy Gibson: Net worth, nationality, career, wedding, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike other black South Africans at the time, Patricia was moderately educated, which is why she could secure a white-collar job. She was also capable of renting an apartment in the area Robert Noah lived.</p><p class=align-left>Patricia Noah and Robert Noah started spending time together as they resided on the same floor of the same apartment. They became good friends over time and liked each other a lot. The two eventually ended up having a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">child together</a>.</p><h2>Robert Noah struggled to accept Trevor Noah</h2><p class=align-left>Robert and Patricia kept their relationship private for several months, but things were about to become even hard when they had a son. Trevor Noah was born on February 20, 1984.</p><p class=align-left>During the time Trevor was born, interracial relationships were forbidden and illegal. Therefore, Trevor's mother had to lie to doctors about his biological father during birth. If it was discovered that it was a biracial child, Trevor's mother could be jailed for five years and the baby placed in an orphanage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are rapper Logic's parents?

This way, he would have less involvement in Trevor's upbringing, and their son would be safe.</p><h2>Was Robert part of Trevor Noah’s life?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ac17f3e42f0a261.jpeg><p class=align-left>Although Robert shied away from parenthood initially, he changed his mind and started looking for his son and his mother later. And they decided to find a way of co-parenting during the challenging apartheid times.</p><p class=align-left>They would meet at the park late when nobody was around and have some great moments. However, things got complicated when Trevor started recognizing his father's face and calling him daddy.</p><p class=align-left>Patricia decided to act as a maid to cover things up and make it easier for Robert to see his son. After some time, apartheid ended, and the two were free to see each other. He moved to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">newly segregated</a> area called Yeoville. Robert would celebrate Trevor's birthday every year and <a href=#>Christmas</a> as well.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e170222373123f8d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Hinchcliffe: Wife, gay, net worth, family, stand up comedy</span></p></a><h2>Trevor Noah loses touch with his father</h2><p class=align-left>When Trevor Noah was 13, he lost touch with his biological father. Then, he was a teenager and had the typical teenage attributes of wanting to spend time away from his parents. On the other hand, his mother, Patricia, had remarried, and his then-husband was averse to her seeing her ex. Therefore, Trevor stayed at home with his mother and stepfather, who had a high temper. Robert Noah eventually moved to Cape Town.</p><h2>Robert’s return to Trevor Noah’s life</h2><p class=align-left>When Trevor Noah grew up, he hated his father because he felt he didn't care about him and had moved away from his life. However, Patricia's kind words about Robert kept those thoughts at bay. Finally, when Trevor turned 24, his mother encouraged him to find his father.</p><p class=align-left>Trevor had not seen Robert for ten years and thought he would never see him again. Since Robert was a private person, Trevor didn't have much to start with while searching for him. He eventually got in touch with the embassy, which wrote a letter to Robert. Trevor made plans to visit him in Cape Town.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e48f6f1b64c743d9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Swaggy C: net worth, real name, big brother, Bayleigh, his TV</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Of course, the first visit was awkward, but they returned to their old routine and reconnected after arriving. Trevor and Robert are currently on good terms.</p><h2>Where is Trevor Noah’s father now?</h2><p class=align-left>Robert is entirely private and has kept his personal life confidential. Since he does not have any social media, his information is scanty. However, when Robert reunited with his son, he was in Cape Town, so he might still live there. Also, it would be best if you kept in mind that he is a traveller and doesn't stay in one location for long, and he might be somewhere else.</p><h2>Quick facts about Robert Noah</h2><li>Does Trevor Noah have a relationship with his dad?
