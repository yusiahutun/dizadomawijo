Well, John is one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.</p><p>Cunningham often keeps her private affairs to herself and does not share her family matters in front of the media. She comes from a wealthy background, and some sources also revealed that her family owned a farm in Chester.</p><p>However, we do have some facts that can help you know your beloved Megan a bit more. Age, ethnicity, religious background and eye colour often rank higher in internet queries. Well, the America-native is 48 years old and shares white ancestry. She has mesmerizing brown eyes and brown hair colour to complement the whole look like a cherry on top. From the looks of it, she does have a decent height.</p><p>Megan Wallace completed her early education and graduated from Vermont.</p><p>We have nothing about her educational credentials or degrees. Until the star enlightens us on her upbringing, the void shall remain as it is. Megan is a successful art dealer by profession, and this fact alone proves her quality of education. Coming from a wealthy background, she must have received teachings from a top-notch tutor or institution.</p><h3><span id=Megan_Wallace_Cunninghams_Net_Worth><strong>Megan Wallace Cunningham’s Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Megan-Wallace-Cunningham-Net-Worth.jpg alt="Megan Wallace Cunningham Net Worth" width=700 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Exact figures or not, Megan is living a lavish life.

The home sat on two-thirds of an acre and was built roughly 115 years ago. With several rooms and outdoor space, the house expands across a 6,812 square feet area.</p><h3><span id=Some_Famous_Profiles_You_Should_Know_About><strong>Some Famous Profiles You Should Know About</strong></span></h3><h3><span id=Megan_Wallace_Cunningham_TV_Personality_Craig_Ferguson><strong>Megan Wallace Cunningham & TV Personality Craig Ferguson</strong></span></h3><p>The popularity of Megan roots back to her marriage with Craig Ferguson. The two first met in 2005 and started dating. Taking their relationship to the next level, the couple exchanged their holy vows on the 21st of December 2008. Despite the popularity of her husband, they decided to keep their ceremony rather private. Only fifteen guests attended the event, which included close friends and family members. The event took place in Megan’s home town Chester, Vermont.</p><p>Together, the couple shares a son named Liam James Ferguson. Craig and Megan had announced their expecting baby in July of 2010.

Ferguson is still fighting against his alcohol addiction to this day, and his wife is there to help him. However, it took two other breakups for the TV personality to settle down finally. Before this association, he was married to two beautiful ladies. His first marriage dates back to 1983 when he started his official relationship with Ann Hogarth.</p><h3 class=qu><span id=Megan_Wallace_Cunningham_is_an_American_art_dealer>Megan Wallace Cunningham is an American art dealer.</span></h3><p>Ann is a graphic designer by profession.
