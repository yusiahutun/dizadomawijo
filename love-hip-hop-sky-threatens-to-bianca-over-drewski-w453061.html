On the Monday, December 5, episode of <i>Love & Hip Hop</i>, it seemed that every couple was having issues. <b>Juelz Santana</b> admitted things had been "shaky" at home ever since <b>Kimbella</b> had "barged in" on his studio session. Since that incident, he had opted to work from the studio in his pad, which Kimbella was thrilled about.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is the reason why we made this at-home studio," she said. To the camera, however, she admitted she "may have overreacted a bit." She also considered that she might "need to loosen the reins," but she wasn't making any promises.</p><p><b>Stormy Skies Ahead</b></p><p>Meanwhile, things were heating up in the love triangle of <b>DJ Drewski</b>, his girlfriend,&nbsp;<b>Sky</b>, and his friend/maybe colleague/ maybe love interest,&nbsp;<b>Bianca</b>. Sky and Drewski were checking out a potential space for an event to kick off her business, Strip and Fitness (which was exactly what it sounded like), when Bianca started "blowing up" Drewski's phone. Sky instructed him to answer it, so he did. Then she heard as Bianca said she had recorded a song called "I Miss You" that reminded her of him.</p><p>Sky didn't like that so much. "I don't feel respected," she said. "Check her, or I'm going to check her for you." Drewski said he would. … Well, he sort of said that. He was noncommittal about the whole thing.</p><p><b>Sky Gives Away Bianca's Song</b></p><p>In retaliation, Sky met up with<b> Mariahlynn</b>. Apparently, the two had met an "industry event." Mariahlynn was hopeful that her new friend Sky would put her music in front of Drewski — but Sky was planning to do something better than that. After a few minutes of small talk, Sky said that Drewski had a new song called "Make It Official," and she wanted Mariahlynn to be on it. (Drewski was already in discussion with Bianca to have her sing that one. Oops.)</p><p>Sky then invited Mariahlynn to her kickoff event for Strip and Fitness. Somewhere else around that same time, Bianca was reasoning that she would back off Drewski if he made Sky his "wifey," but until then, she was going to do as she pleased.</p><p><b>Snoop Gets Relationship Advice from Juelz</b></p><p>Following her blowup fight with her girlfriend, Jade, <b>Snoop</b> met up with Juelz for advice on how to juggle personal relationships with business. Snoop told Juelz what happened (i.e., that she had gotten flirty with the podcast host), and Juelz said she had "gone too far." Snoop was trying to figure out if she could deal with Jade's jealousy and stay in the relationship.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jade was meeting with Kimbella for her own set of advice. "I'm so overwhelmed, and on top of that, I'm away from my family," Jade argued. "I'm away from my son, and she's acting stupid." Kimbella told Jade to be a strong woman and focus on what she wanted to do rather than continuing to put Snoop front and center.</p><p><b>Mendeecees' Baby Mamas (and Grandmas) Have It Out</b></p><p>There was also trouble brewing amongst the women tied to incarcerated Mendeecees Harris. <b>Yandy</b> (his current wife) was bickering with <b>Erika</b> (the mother of his second child) and <b>Samantha</b>. Oh,&nbsp;<b>Kim Wallace </b>(Samantha's mother) was in on the action too. All of the women kept arguing about who was doing the worst job taking care of their kids (none of them seemed too concerned with the fact that Mendeecees was participating least of all since he was in jail, but whatever).</p><p>Judy, Samantha, Erika and Kim all met up to try to hash things out, but it backfired, and Kim became upset enough that they feared she was having a heart attack. She was taken away in an ambulance.</p><p><b>Strip and Fit and Fight</b></p><p>The launch party finally arrived, and<b> Cardi B</b> (who was good friends with Mariahlynn) couldn't wait to watch the drama go down between Mariahlynn, Bianca, Sky and Drewski. Because Mariahlynn and Bianca were also friendly, Mariahlynn said she wanted to make sure that Sky hadn't given her a record that actually belonged to her friend (which is pretty much exactly what she did).</p><p>Mariahlynn, Cardi B and Bianca snuggled into a booth together and laughed about how they were all wearing the same wig in different colors. That's when Sky came over and said hello, calling Bianca "the woman that wants my man." She and Bianca then got in an argument about whether Drewski ever called Bianca, and Sky threatened to end Bianca's career by forbidding her boyfriend from playing her songs on the radio.</p><p>Drewski wandered over to try to do some damage control, but it was already too late. He wasn't too thrilled to hear that Sky had given the record to Mariahlynn that he had been planning to give to Bianca, but before he got a word in, Sky snapped, "You're not playing her music no more." She then turned to Bianca and added, "And you're not going to be on that record!"</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: Do you think Drewski is going to stay with Sky?</p><p><i>Love & Hip Hop </i>airs on VH1 Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitaq8jKGmqWWjoMZuwMernJqslaPAbsDOZpmimZ6Yrm671Z6pZpyimsS0t8hmrm1tY2WDcns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christie-brinkley-beach-home-turks-caicos-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christie Brinkley's jaw-dropping beach house you can rent out  take a tour">&larr;
