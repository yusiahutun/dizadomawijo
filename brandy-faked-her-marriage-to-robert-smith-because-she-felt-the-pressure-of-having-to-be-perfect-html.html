A year later, the couple separated.</p><p id=par-8_38>Shortly after their split, Smith dropped a huge bombshell no one saw coming, which was that he and the “Have You Ever” singer <a href=#>never married</a> and had faked their union so that they could preserve her picture-perfect image.</p><p id=par-9_18>Brandy also admitted she and Smith never tied the knot but claimed that they had a “spiritual union.”</p><p id=par-10_62>“We still share a common bond through our daughter, Sy’ rai,” the actress said in a statement. “He is not thinking about her, me, or what we had together. He is trying to destroy my reputation while using me and our daughter to get publicity and radio airplay for his artists. I am stunned that he is being so dirty about it.”</p><h2>Brandy came clean about her fake marriage in 2014</h2><p id=par-11_41>Eleven years after Smith revealed that there had never been a marriage, Brandy finally admitted she had lied about being married, explaining to Winfrey on Oprah: Where Are They Now? the reason why she told that “big fib” back in 2002.</p><p id=par-12_30>According to the singer, having a child out of wedlock was not a trend at that time, and she felt she would be judged if she told everyone the truth.</p><p id=par-13_25>“At that time, being pregnant out of wedlock was not a trend. It was not something people praised,” she told Winfrey. “It was a sin.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_22>Brandy also said that since she was known for her innocent, clean-cut reputation, she felt the pressure to maintain that specific image.</p><p id=par-15_53>“I felt I couldn’t be honest about that. I felt the pressure of having to be perfect. And I was scared,” Brandy admitted. “I thought that everything that I have worked hard for and everything that I worked to build — the image that I worked so hard to build — was threatened.”</p><p id=par-16_37>Though the singer told the lie more than a decade prior, she still felt remorse for lying to Winfrey. “I’m really sorry for that,” Brandy told the media mogul. “I mean, you just don’t lie to Oprah!”</p><p id=par-17_47>Since then, Brandy has just been focused on being a mom and her career. Though she’s dated and has gotten engaged a few times over the last few years, Brandy insists that she prefers the single life and claims that she <a href=#>no sees marriage in her future</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs63NnbBmnpGgsqV5x56pZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZK2nXae8o7HRrWSspZmptW6uxJyYrquVYsCpsYyfnKWsXam1pnnPq5ysq6Wnsm67xWafmq6Zo7RuwM5mmZ5loJq%2Fp7HCrWWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./man-jailed-life-kidnap-murder-three-week-old-baby-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eliza De La Cruz: Man jailed for life for kidnap and murder of baby">&larr;
