Ballistics tests confirmed one of the guns was used in all three shootings.</span></p><p><span>'It feels wonderful to cause their death and to watch their pain,' he said in one of 81 letters he wrote to a former girlfriend while awaiting his trial. The writings from the magna cum laude Southern Methodist University graduate were introduced into evidence.</span></p><p><span>'God forbid I ever had my finger on the button to launch a nuclear explosive device because I guarantee that I would wipe as many of these bastards off the face of the planet as I am able!' he said in another letter.</span></p><p><span>Without remorse, he also acknowledged the killings while testifying at his capital murder trial.</span></p><p><span>Evidence showed he got into trouble as a juvenile, had drug possession and selling issues and wound up in state custody.

'He threatened to kill me personally.'</span></p><p><span>The dead man's two truck driver victims were killed about 45 minutes apart on August 24, 1998. Prosecutors said Feldman became enraged after Everett cut him off, so he shot him and then later, simply because he was still angry, shot Velasquez.</span></p><p><span>Feldman was the 503rd inmate to be put to death in Texas since reinstatement.</span></p><p><span>Feldman's attorney, Robin Norris, filed a clemency petition with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles that was turned down Monday. Multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected Norris' appeals on Feldman's behalf.</span></p><p><span>At Feldman's murder trial, prosecutors produced evidence of numerous confrontations initiated by Feldman, including one where he jumped on the hood of another driver's car, smashed it with hammer, and then used the hammer to beat the windshield, a door and the driver.</span></p><p><span>'I have come to hate every single person on this planet with all my heart and soul,' he told a former girlfriend in one of 81 letters to her while awaiting trial. 'If I had a button which would kill every single person on this planet, I would push it with no hesitation whatsoever!'</span><br></p><p><span>Evidence showed Feldman was riding his Harley-Davidson bike on U.S. Highway 75 just north of Dallas when the 18-wheeler driven by Everett passed and then pulled into Feldman's lane.<br></span></p><p><span>Feldman was enraged, pulled out his pistol and fired several shots at the back of the truck trailer. Then he reloaded and pulled up alongside the truck cab.</span></p><p><span>'I chased Mr Everett down and I shot him to death,' Feldman testified at his trial. 'I felt like I needed to stop that man.'</span><br></p><p><span>Eleven miles later, and after circling back to make sure Everett was dead, Feldman spotted Velasquez, driver of an Exxon fuel tanker, replenishing tanks at a Dallas gas station.</span><br></p><p><span>'I exploded again in anger,' he testified. 'I drove by and shot him. It was just acting out. I felt emotionally compelled and consumed by anger.'</span></p><p><span>'I have found it quite pleasurable to kill those two men,' he said in another letter to his ex-girlfriend.</span><br></p><p><span>The day before the fatal shootings, evidence showed he shot up a Volkswagen dealership where he once had some work done.<br></span></p><p><span>Feldman was arrested about a week later after shooting a man outside a fast-food restaurant.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FdISRbGdwZ3Skwqi4wKxkf52cmbqiuoydoJ6rXYmyua3SZp2ippGjsKqty2aYp5mcrsC1edOuqaedlGK%2FsK3DZqman5ViuKq4y56pZpyZmsBuv82oqaKml2LBprjLrGScmaKntqawjJ2cmqyYYsCmutOepZydXau2pMDIpqpnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eating-chocolate-asthma-attack-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eating chocolate can give you an asthma attack">&larr;
