Though the singer's appearance was a surprise to her fans, Paul, 40, often sits courtside at basketball games. The successful agent represents several NBA superstars, including Los Angeles Lakers players LeBron James and Anthony Davis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since their first outing, the couple has been spotted out in several cities, eating out and attending friends' parties in Los Angeles, New York, and London. The pair went Instagram-official in September 2021, in a photo dump on Adele's page, which included a pic of them attending Davis' wedding. They also attended another NBA game last month, enjoying the season opener between the Los Angeles Lakers vs. Golden State Warriors in L.A.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Adele opened up about her relationship with Paul in her intimate interview with Oprah Winfrey, revealing what drew her to the super agent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He's hilarious. He's very, very smart. It's quite incredible watching him do what he does. And just the easiness of it. It's been very smooth," she said, before noting that she was blushing at that moment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The singer also said that the relationship is the first time she "loved [herself] and been open to loving and being loved by someone else."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here's what we know about the super agent himself, and their relationship.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He's one of the NBA's biggest agents.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cleveland, Ohio native Paul became a sports agent after meeting teenage LeBron James in 2002. The duo became close friends and confidants, with Paul working at Creative Artists Agency, under James's then-agent Leon Rose. He later struck out on his own, founding his agency Klutch Sports Group in 2012.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His all-star client list includes James, his Los Angeles Lakers teammate Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers, Golden State Warriors player Draymond Green, and Lonzo Ball of the Chicago Bulls, among many others. Paul is also currently working on a memoir to be published by Roc Lit 101, the publishing division of Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Paul and Adele started dating earlier this year.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/adele-new-album-30-divorce-tour-1255774/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rolling Stone</a>, the singer recalled that she and Paul met on a dance floor at a mutual friend’s birthday party years ago. She reconnected with the agent last spring, around the time her father passed. In August 2021, a source told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.eonline.com/news/1295914/notoriously-private-adele-says-she-s-not-concerned-about-her-very-public-new-romance?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories&utm_source=eonline&utm_medium=rssfeeds&utm_campaign=rss_topstories" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=E! class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">E!</a> that the relationship was a "bit of a whirlwind," and that the singer was comfortable with the relationship being more public.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She's not as concerned about being private with her life because she's very happy with Rich," the source said. "[She's] enjoying learning about the sports world and meeting many of Rich's friends. She's going with it and is very happy."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Adele called the relationship the "easiest" she's ever been in.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The singer called the relationship with Paul the most "incredible, openhearted, and easiest" one she's ever been in, revealing that the agent has also met her son, Angelo. She also shared that the celebrity gossip account DeuxMoi outed the couple, with photos of the pair at a discount mall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I didn’t really tell many of my friends at the beginning because I wanted to keep it to myself,” she recalled. “None of them believed it!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also reflected on the growth she's experienced, both through self-discovery and healing after her divorce and her relationship with Paul.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I’m not frightened of loneliness anymore," she said.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They may have bought a house together.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On May 11, 2022 the singer shared an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39970894/adele-boyfriend-rich-paul-buy-house/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram carrousel featuring photos" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram carrousel featuring photos</a> of her and Paul's relationship. And one of the photos was of her and the sports agent standing in front of a white house holding up keys. So naturally, fans are now speculating that the two have bought a house together, though Adele has yet to give more details.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Paul has hinted at having more kids.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1334275/adeles-boyfriend-rich-paul-hints-at-having-more-kids%5C data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E! News" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">E! News</a>, Paul opened up about balancing fatherhood and entrepreneurship when he was young, and how he wants to be "a more patient dad" if he has more kids. The 40-year-old doesn't speak publicly about his kids often, though he does mention that he has a daughter currently in college.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As a young dad, growing a business, it was pretty tough," he told the outlet. "But now looking as an older dad, if I was to have more kids, I'm looking forward to being a different dad."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued, "Oftentimes as you're building a business, you're on the go, you're moving around, the kids grow up fast in a blink of an eye. Next thing, you know, they're walking and they're riding the bike, running and flipping around and that's the problem."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have a daughter that's a junior in college so I was a very young dad, but now, different age, different time in my life, different position in my life. I'm really looking forward to being an older dad," he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mention comes after Adele mentioned <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39055026/adele-baby-graham-norton-show/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wanting another baby" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wanting another baby</a> during a Graham Norton Show interview last February.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
