However, if sources are to be believed, his royal highness may be able to spend Christmas with Camilla, William, and Princess Kate while carving out some time during New Year's Day festivities for Meghan Markle, Harry, and their children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tatler</a>, Harry “is reported to like the idea of returning to the U.K. for Christmas and would be unlikely to decline an invitation to spend the festive season with his father [King Charles]. However, so far, no offer has been shared with the Sussexes.” A different report shared that it's unusual that holiday plans aren't settled just yet, though with tensions high, things could still be getting ironed out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A report from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;shared that Charles “has made it clear that Harry — and his family — are welcome to stay on royal property if they come to the U.K.” Sources added that “plans are normally nailed down by now, as Sandringham isn’t a particularly big place, and there’s not a lot of room for the entire extended family. It would be surprising for the Sussexes not to have received an invitation by now if there was going to be one. New Year in Scotland would be more likely. But, as with anything to do with Harry and Meghan, let’s face it, anything can happen.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The space limitations can be traced to Camilla, who likely invited her children Tom and Laura to the royal holiday activities. So, believe it or not, the royals might be cramped with everyone, including Kate, William, their children, and Camilla's grown kids all in one place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hello</a>&nbsp;even reported that the traditional holiday lunch will have to be served in a larger ballroom at Sandringham and not the formal dining room, which has been tradition for ... forever.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the Sussexes,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a>&nbsp;reports that Charles has suggested that they come after the Christmas holiday and spend the first days of the New Year with the family. That'll keep Harry and William apart and everyone can avoid that awkward family moment.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It would certainly have the advantage of killing two birds with one stone, extending an olive branch to one son without causing difficulty to the other," sources close to the family shared with&nbsp;The Mirror.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harry and Meghan haven’t spent the holiday at Sandringham since 2018. Louella Alderson, a relationship expert, told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a>&nbsp;that even if they don't make the trip to the U.K., Harry and Meghan have plenty of people in California that will make sure that they have a “special holiday season,” though she adds that “it’s possible that Harry may feel a sense of loneliness during the holiday season, especially if he is house hunting in the U.K. and has a desire to spend Christmas in the U.K. this year."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Being homesick and missing British traditions and celebrations could make the holiday periods more difficult for him," she added. "It’s also possible that he may choose to return to the U.K. for a visit at a later time when tensions have eased and it feels right for him. Ultimately, while Christmas in America may be a different experience for Harry, he will still have people who care about him and make sure he has a special holiday season.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Royal expert Jennie Bond told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>OK</a>&nbsp;that things will be awkward whether or not Harry is present and accounted for at Christmas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Harry’s absence from the celebrations at Sandringham will be painfully obvious," she said. "Little Archie and Lilibet should be running around with their many cousins, pulling crackers, opening presents, and understanding their place in the family, connecting with their relatives even though their lives are thousands of miles away.”<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>See More</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKloGWTna6zuMSsZKmno6i2o7jEZp%2BopJmZrrp5z6WYp6tdpb%2BqusKeZLChnKG2ormMoZirqqlihXV8lWtoag%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chef-brad-leone-inside-1750s-connecticut-farmhouse-exclusive-7557345.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brad Leone's Renovated Connecticut Farmhouse Home: See Inside (Exclusive)">&larr;
