This behavior is mostly prevalent in adolescents and young adults, as they have a developing prefrontal cortex which makes them prone to risky behaviors.

Though things might be changing now, it hasn’t fully changed. Therefore, sexting can have severe social consequences. As it may bring guilt and shame for the people who engage in this behavior. Also, the people who go through sextortion because of sexting might not be able to say anything to anyone about it and give in to the blackmailer.
