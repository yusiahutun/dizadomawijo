Take this BBC property which was once an HBO exclusive, and now is somehow on Peacock. The creators of The Office reunited for an incredibly funny look at the people on the fringe of Hollywood, featuring some amazing guest turns from stars like Ben Stiller, Patrick Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson, and an unforgettable Kate Winslet.</p>Extras <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>peacock</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckrmlh7lu00193h6pkqgtlaya@published><a data-vars-anchor-text=Girls5Eva href=#>Girls5Eva</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfsf6j6j00b33b70j2x5ow6b@published data-word-count=8><strong>Years: </strong>2021-2022<br><strong>Length: </strong>2 seasons, 16 episodes<br><strong>Creator: </strong>Meredith Scardino</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrmlgg6x00143h6pwmujcca8@published data-word-count=78>One of the funniest shows on TV is about to pull a weird trick and jump from <a href=#>Peacock to Netflix</a> after the former canceled it after two seasons.

In fact, it won Best Comedy for its first five seasons with three of its performers—Ty Burrell, Eric Stonestreet, Julie Bowen—taking home multiple awards themselves.
