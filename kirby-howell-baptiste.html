Following the announcement that the famed fantasy author's characters would be adapted for a Netflix series, casting information was released. That's when it was revealed that Kirby Howell-Baptiste had been cast as Death, the older sister of the titular Sandman, a.k.a. Dream.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/10/19/kirby-howell-baptiste-is-an-actress-who-is-from-the-united-kingdom--1666168669.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Kirby Howell-Baptiste is an actress who is from the United Kingdom. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>Gaiman admitted in a Netflix article about the casting process that the role of Death was "significantly harder" to cast than he had anticipated, claiming they'd seen "hundreds" of women prior to Howell-audition. Baptiste's claimed that it was only after seeing her in action that "we knew we had our Death."</p><p></p><p>Purists were outraged when a Black actress was cast as a white character in the original comics. While Howell-Baptiste did not respond publicly to the fan outrage, Gaiman did. "If you think the Endless have a specific human race or form, you've missed something in 'Sandman,'" Gaiman declared on Twitter, later doubling down. "I always thought people liked Death for who she was, the person I created," he continued. "I'm surprised to learn that some people thought she was just a white woman."</p><h2><strong>Kirby Howell-Baptiste Is a Caring Sister in Her Role as Death in "The Sandman."</strong></h2><p>As per <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a></strong>, In the sixth episode of The Sandman, titled The Sound of Her Wings, Kirby Howell-Baptiste plays the role of <strong>Death</strong>, and the way she portrays the character is nuanced and fascinating to observe.

All of this comes from Kirby, who embodies brilliant positivity with such sincerity that it is like watching an immortal being stroll among mortals. Howell-Baptiste is the source of all of this.</p><p>Listening to Kirby's talk on life and Death provides viewers with an optimistic and oddly reassuring glimpse at what might lie ahead for us when our time on earth is done. Her entire performance in this episode is a balancing act between her position as Death and her role as Dream's sister, and she manages to pull it off by being both earthy and ethereal in her portrayal of both parts.</p><p><strong>Stay updated in <a href=# rel=noopener>Married Wiki</a> for more celebrity biography, articles, and news.</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>#the sandman</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomebnr%2BjxYyhprCdnKF6o63PraCsrJU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./showstopping-celeb-wedding-guest-shoes-princess-beatrice-victoria-beckham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Showstopping celeb wedding guest shoes: From Princess Beatrice's trainers to Victoria Beckham's skys">&larr;
