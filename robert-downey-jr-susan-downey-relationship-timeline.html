They saw how happy I was.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She gave Robert an ultimatum. “I did meet Darth Vader, for like a minute,” she says, referring to the name that Robert has used for his dark side. “Right after the movie wrapped, and I said immediately, ‘This isn’t gonna work.’ I made it clear that to stay with me, nothing could happen.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actor ultimately threw his drugs into the ocean and decided to get sober. Reflecting on that pivotal decision, Susan says, “I think he saw what we had. There was something magical there, something we couldn’t put our finger on. He always says that we became this third thing when we got together—something that neither of us could have become by ourselves—and I think that’s true.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Susan also opens up about her relationship with stepson Indio, whom Robert shares with ex-wife Deborah Falconer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With stepkids, it’s hard at first,” she says. “But, like anything, my approach was to just be honest about it and not try and force anything—not act like we were a big family right away. What’s come from that is a really great relationship with Indio, because I didn’t try to make it into something it wasn’t…until one day, it was.”</p><h2 data-node-id=52 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">August 27, 2005: They get married.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Robert and Susan tie the knot in a star-studded wedding ceremony <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fosters.com/story/entertainment/2005/08/28/robert-downey-jr-marries-producer/53174479007/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in the Hamptons" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">in the Hamptons</a>, which features performances by Sting and Billy Joel.</p><h2 data-node-id=54 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">November 5, 2003: They get engaged.</h2><img alt="robert downey jr and susan levin during hollywood film festival centerpiece gala film premiere the singing detective at the arclight in hollywood, california, united states photo by sgranitzwireimage" title="Hollywood Film Festival - Centerpiece Gala Film Premiere - &amp;amp;quot;The Singing Detective&amp;amp;quot;" width=2093 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-106707583-65e74c814834b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Steve Granitz</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple announce their engagement just a few months after first meeting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Robert describes his fiancée in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/the-comeback-kid/all data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oprah Winfrey" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Oprah Winfrey</a>, saying, “I just feel like she’s my best friend and we really get along well.
