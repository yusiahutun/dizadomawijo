She rose to fame after giving birth to a daughter, <strong>Royalty Brown&nbsp;</strong>with <strong>Chris Brown</strong>.</p><p><strong>Nia Guzman</strong> is an American model and aspiring nurse, well known as the mother of <strong>Chris Brown’s </strong>child. She even worked as a nurse while carrying a baby in her belly. In today’s topic, we will be talking about all the alleged relationship of Nia. In fact, here we will be presenting her age, dating, boyfriend, child, nationality earning, net worth and many others.</p><h2>Early Life of Nia Guzman</h2><p>Nia Guzman was born on July 22, 1983, in&nbsp;Corpus Christi, Texas United States of America. As of 2019, Nia is 35-year-old. She holds an American nationality and belongs to Hispanic ethnicity. Further, her zodiac sign is Cancer.</p><p>On the contrary, nothing is revealed about her family as well as her educational background. Furthermore, there is no official information concerning her childhood days.</p><h2>Married to Terry Amey</h2><p>Previously Nia Guzman was married to<strong> Terry Amey</strong>&nbsp;in 2003&nbsp;when Guzman was just 20 years old. They shared a child together,&nbsp;<strong>Zillah Jade Amey. </strong>However, their marriage relation didn’t last for long and they got divorced on October 15, 2014. The reason for their separation was being caught having an extra-marital affair with <strong>Chris Brown</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Nia-Guzman.jpg><p>Furthermore, she was found to be pregnant with Brown’s baby and their friendship fell apart when custody issues started. Their separation finalized after a month after she gave birth to Brown’s daughter <strong>Royalty&nbsp;Brown</strong> on May 27, 2014.&nbsp;Later on, she was denied full custody of her daughter, Royalty in August&nbsp; 2016 after she was ordered to pay back attorney fees.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a class=yoast-link-suggestion__value href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>Chase Chrisley Age, Family, Affairs, Height & Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>On the other hand, Chris and his former partner, <strong>Karrueche Tran</strong> broke up after she found out about his affair and child with Nia. Back in May 2018,&nbsp;Royalty celebrated her fourth birthday with a grand party that cost more than <strong>$30 thousand</strong>.</p><p>Further, it was revealed that Tran and Guzman knew each other and had also been photographed together at an event.</p><p>Moreover, talking about the custody, Chris is currently paying <strong>$2,500</strong> per month in addition to&nbsp;<strong>$4,000</strong> to her own mother (baby’s nanny). However, Guzman is not satisfied with his and is claiming to increase it. Additionally, she also says that she is having a hard time accumulating the money and Chris Brown owes&nbsp;<strong>$250,000</strong> to her.</p><p><strong>YouTube</strong><strong>: Nia Guzman with her daughter, Royalty Brown</strong></p><p></p><p>After her relationship with Chris Brown, she was in a relationship with her ex-boyfriend <strong>King Ba</strong>. Currently, Guzman has not been linked to anyone and has not revealed her dating information to the media as she is not open sharing information regarding boyfriend, affairs. As of now, it seems she is not in a hurry to get married for a second time.</p><h2>Salary And Net Worth</h2><p>Throughout her career as a model, she has earned a decent amount and has gathered an appreciable net worth. Furthermore, she is the ower of the Unisex clothing line<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Claire Hosterman Age, Bio, Wiki, Boyfriend, Net Worth & Height” (Edit)" data-wpel-link=internal>Claire Hosterman Age, Bio, Wiki, Boyfriend, Net Worth & Height</a></strong></p><p>Moreover, the clothing line sells a wide variety of clothes like two pieces, cosmetic and several other products. However, it is estimated she earns a good income that contributes to the overall net worth from her own clothing line and a good amount that she gets in child support from Chris Brown. Not only this, she has a massive fan following on her social sites and gathers good fortune from there as well.</p><p>Hence, the 35-year-old Nia’s net worth of 2019 is still under review.
