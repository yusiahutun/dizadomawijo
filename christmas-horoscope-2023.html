Your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas horoscope 2023</a> will help guide you through the highs and lows of your holiday to help you have a holly jolly day.</p><p>The astrological forecast predicts that the sun will be in stoic Capricorn while <a href=#>the moon will</a><a href=#>be</a> <a href=#>in playful Gemini</a> on Christmas Day. The sun in Capricorn will encourage us to keep up with our holiday traditions. Meanwhile, the moon in Gemini will remind us to go with the flow. Between the structured solar energy and mutable lunar energy, these two luminaries can work together to help you embrace whatever comes up throughout Christmas Day. If anything, try to keep the conversations light and merry instead of focusing on more sobering topics around the Christmas tree.&nbsp;</p><p>Mercury will still be retrograde all throughout Christmas. Although <a href=#>Mercury</a><a href=#>retrograde in Sagittarius</a> will not affect other heavenly bodies, Mercury retrograde will still be an underlying energy to consider throughout the holiday. Common Mercury retrograde themes typically include technical issues, travel mishaps, and miscommunication. Since this can cause more stress, you may want to be proactive to avoid unnecessary issues. My best advice is to avoid controversial topics at Christmas dinner, plan accordingly for travel delays, and get warranties for any technological gifts.</p><p>You’ll be on “Team No Sleep” since Mars in Sagittarius will sextile <a href=#>the South Node in Libra</a> and <a href=#>the</a><a href=#>North Node in Aries</a> at 2:01 a.m. ET. The kids will be excitedly pacing in their rooms hoping to hear Santa’s jolly laugh, or you could be up late wrapping last-minute gifts for your loved ones. Since everyone will be up no matter what, you should get into the holiday spirit by watching some old-timey Christmas specials!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-11.png><p>Christmas morning could be a healing experience as the moon in Gemini harmonizes <a href=#>with </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiron</a><a href=#> retrograde in Aries</a> at 7:21 a.m. ET. Emotional fulfillment and peace could come in many forms during this transit. You may receive a special gift that touches your heart. Healing could also look like spending your Christmas morning the way you’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p><p>Holiday plans will be in full swing <a href=#>when </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus</a><a href=#> in Scorpio</a> forms a magical trine with Neptune in Pisces at 12:14 p.m. ET. As this fantastical trine unfolds, there may be heartfelt expressions of love and gratitude. Seeing distant relatives and connecting with your loved ones will be exceptionally emotional. You may even be surprised by how you and your loved ones knew exactly what to give each other. A compassionate vibe will be imminent, so this trine will surely bring everyone together.&nbsp;</p><p>So much will be said between dinner and desserts <a href=#>when the </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">moon</a><a href=#> in Gemini</a> forms a trine with the South Node in Libra and sextiles the North Node in Aries at 7:48 p.m. ET. While this may seem initially gossipy, you could view these transits as an opportunity to catch up with your loved ones. You might hear something scandalous about someone from your hometown. It could even be the perfect time to share some exciting news of your own. But <a href=#>Mercury retrograde will </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">be</a><a href=#> in effect</a>, so try to avoid fighting over Grandma’s Christmas turkey and homemade gingerbread house.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-12.png><p>As Christmas Day winds down, the energy might pick up when the moon in Gemini creates a daunting opposition <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Mars in </a><a href=#>Sagittarius</a> at 9:08 p.m. ET. Just when you least expect it, something will come out at the last possible minute. Maybe someone will have too many mugs of spiked eggnog and pick a silly fight. Perhaps the kids will finally have an overtired meltdown after a day of sugar, spice, and everything nice. Since this opposition will be undoubtedly messy, you may want to head home unless you want to be privy to the Christmas Day drama. After all, it wouldn’t be Christmas without a little family drama!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect on Christmas Day, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.3112014453478><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Focus on what you need to get through Christmas Day, Aries. You might be worried about how conversations about your love life and career path will go with certain family members. Talking about your relationship status or work opportunities with your loved ones can be stressful. It might be worthwhile to ask your favorite family members for support during Christmas. Having your siblings, cousins, or parents on your side could help you feel less alone when these challenging conversations occur.&nbsp;</p><p>Once your Christmas Day plans begin, you might be surprised by how well everything will go. Granted, there might still be some hiccups here or there if you feel extra sensitive about your relationships and commitments. Let any comments or questions roll off your shoulders rather than having a deeper discussion. However, you may have to redirect the conversation a few times during dinnertime. Luckily, you could get through most of the holiday unscathed if you keep a level head and lean on your support system.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7957681692732><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Have faith in your gift-giving skills, Taurus. Being ruled by lovely Venus means you’re a thoughtful, extravagant gift giver. However, your budget may have been tighter than usual this year. Instead of stressing over how much you can afford to give, focus your attention on the sentiment and quality of your gifts. By Christmas morning, you should feel increasingly confident that everyone will love what you have chosen for them.&nbsp;</p><p>As everyone comes together throughout Christmas Day, you might be rather pleased by how appreciative everyone will be. Your loved ones may even compliment you up and down on how beautiful your homemade gifts will be. When you least expect it, you could be surprised with an incredibly thoughtful gift by one of your loved ones. Work will likely be a hot topic at Christmas dinner. However, these conversations could get a little stressful if money comes up. Take a more neutral position if you don’t want to discuss your professional and financial status.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7424975798645><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>You’ll be more popular than Santa Claus on Christmas Day, Gemini! Not only will you hear from family, but you may even hear from people all over the globe. Old colleagues, former flames, distant friends, and more will reach out to wish you a very merry Christmas. While it will be nice to reconnect with this many people, you could feel somewhat overwhelmed. Put your phone on “Do Not Disturb” if you want to have a quieter Christmas morning.</p><p>Since you’ll be the talk of the town, you might be a little wary about why some individuals are reaching out to you. Unfortunately, your intuition might be the only thing you can count on for intel. However, you may hear something juicy around Christmas dinner that could confirm your suspicions. Once you get this information, you can do one of two things. You could either confront the problem head on or save it for another day to focus on family fun.

Although family time and holiday traditions mean the world, you should still carve out some personal time. Christmas morning will be the perfect time since you can wake up earlier to enjoy peace and quiet. You can spend Christmas morning journaling, meditating, or enjoying a warm cup of hot cocoa. Using this time to decompress will help you get into the holiday spirit by the time your family gets together.</p><p>Around midday, you may feel like the true meaning of Christmas is the time you get to spend with your loved ones. An overwhelming feeling of love will be present as everyone gathers to enjoy the holiday together. Don’t be surprised if you shed a few happy tears throughout the day! Christmas dinner will have a more nostalgic vibe as everyone reminisces.

Starting early Christmas morning, you may feel like this holiday will have an incredibly different vibe from past Christmases. You may receive some undeniable signs and signals from the universe about how this Christmas could unfold. Your intuition may pick up on receiving something from your wish list wrapped up under the Christmas tree, or you may feel the urge to reconnect with someone that you deeply cherish.</p><p>The Christmas miracles won’t stop there either since a deeper feeling of love and gratitude will emerge in the afternoon. Even if your Christmas Day is more intimate, you may feel immensely fulfilled. Surrounding yourself with the people that you love will be the key to having a magical holiday. Light-hearted discussions, witty banter, and riveting conversations will carry into the evening. It could spark a desire to do something fun, like play a game.

For some, Christmas is the time to catch up on all of the family news and drama. But for you, this might be the time to brag about your accomplishments and keep everything else on the down low. You could even have a family meeting on Christmas morning to ask everyone to keep your business confidential. Doing so could save you a world of trouble throughout Christmas Day.</p><p>No matter what, you may feel like you could get through Christmas without any issues by the mid-afternoon. Spirits will be high, and drama will be low. However, the mood may shift by dinnertime. As you gather around the table, family members will ask about your life and career. Have a light tone and talk about the high points of your year. However, some family members may press you throughout the rest of the evening. You may have to leave earlier than expected if you want to avoid any stressful interactions.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7771084337349><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>Expect to hit some bumps in the road, Libra. You may feel like you have to be everything at once on Christmas Day, so go over your schedule that morning. Reviewing where you want to go, what to bring, and when to get there can help you streamline your day. Planning accordingly can help you avoid sitting in hours of traffic or turning around to go home after realizing you forgot something halfway through the trip.</p><p>Despite the hiccups in your plans, you may feel relatively at ease by mid-afternoon. Since everyone else will have fun, you should pour yourself a Christmas cocktail to enjoy the holiday vibes! Exciting conversations about love and work may arise during dinnertime. You may even have wonderful news to share, like talking about a new work opportunity or divulging your next steps in love. The conversation could take a turn by the end of the night, so this might be your cue to go home. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8258003766478><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Scorpio, this could be the Christmas that you will remember forever. Make your Christmas morning a private affair by focusing on creating your traditions. You might choose to be by yourself or share this time with someone special. No matter what you do or who you do it with, you will feel immensely fulfilled by tailoring your Christmas morning to your desires. Enjoy these moments before seeing your loved ones later on.</p><p>You should embrace the Christmas spirit around the afternoon, especially if you plan on being with your loved ones. Although Christmas can be a sensitive holiday, you will have nothing to worry about. Everyone will be in a fantastic mood as heartfelt sentiments are expressed, and thoughtful gifts are exchanged.

This Christmas could go one of two ways depending on your relationship status. If you’re in a relationship, then you may feel overwhelmed by spending the holidays with your partner. Instead of brushing off your holiday nerves, you should use this as an opportunity to get closer to your partner. Be vulnerable about your holiday worries since your partner will be there for you if you let them.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re single, then you might hope that Santa Claus left you a soulmate under the Christmas tree. Although it can be stressful to be single this time of year, you shouldn’t let it get to you. After all, being home for the holidays could be a chance to reconnect with someone special or an ex. Your loved ones may even encourage you to reach out to your former flame during Christmas dinner.

As a serious earth sign, you usually don’t stray from your usual healthy habits and routines. However, you may want to make Christmas the exception! Christmas Day doesn’t have to run like a well-oiled machine. If anything, Christmas should be easy going since this is the time to see your loved ones, give gifts, and relax.&nbsp;</p><p>However, your extended family could be challenging since some of your family members could hold you to a different standard. But Christmas is supposed to be fun, so don’t be afraid to indulge. After all, who can resist festive drinks and your family’s cooking? Giving yourself the freedom to cut loose could be a healing experience. And if anyone has something to say about what you’re doing, then ignore it. You deserve to have a fun holiday, especially if you spent so much time and energy making the magic for the rest of your family.

Despite the ongoing travel issues with Mercury retrograde, you will make it home just in time for Christmas Day. There will be nothing more important than spending quality time with your family, especially if certain family members are getting older.

You can expect to be busy preparing food, fixing decorations, welcoming guests, and more. Thankfully, this could provide you with an opportunity for one-on-one time with your parents, siblings, or grandparents. By the early evening, you and your family will be proud of the spread you all created. Dinnertime conversations should go well, and you may feel inspired to end the night with a fun-filled family activity.
