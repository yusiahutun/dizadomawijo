The most popular treatment has been the HK$2,588 Megaboost, Reviv’s signature infusion that contains “a host of vitamins and detoxifying, anti-ageing glutathione” and claims to restore hydration, replenish essential minerals and vitamins, boost the immune system, deliver an energy boost, detoxify the body and cleanse vital organs (I tried it – see <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Post health editor joins the IV league with wellness drip</span></a>).<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung declines to reveal the specific ingredients that go into each Reviv infusion, and would only say they are “set formulas that have gone through many R&D cycles”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reviv is not the first in the city to offer IV therapy. Dr Lauren Bramley & Partners, a family medical practice in Central, has prescribed IV infusions since late 2012. Dr Winnie Mui, a family physician in the practice, says about 10 patients get the infusions each week, mostly fatigued athletes, weekend warriors and professionals who travel frequently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/images/methode/2016/08/01/e35c64b2-548f-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_236x.JPG?itok=u7sz_b7K">The treatment has been so popular that the practice is expanding to have a special area just for IV therapy. “Sometimes we actually run out of the medications and vitamins, and have to turn patients away,” Mui says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike Reviv, Mui’s clinic only prescribes the treatment for existing patients. Two types of IV vitamin therapy are offered for boosting immunity and replenishing energy: a vitamin B12 shot (HK$299) and the Myer’s Cocktail (HK$1,500), an infusion that consists of magnesium, calcium and vitamin B complex, B5, B6, B12 and vitamin C.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The clinic, like Reviv HK, declines to reveal the specific dosage of ingredients of the infusion. Often, the infusions are customised based on the patient’s genetics and lab results. Mui says most patients get the shots twice a year; “very sick” patients may come back once a week for up to 10 weeks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The staff at Dr Lauren Bramley & Partners also receive the treatment twice a year as well, Mui says, usually when they fall ill or feel like a flu is coming on. “It helps,” Mui says, “but not all the time. For fatigue, in general, one shot is enough to make you feel better.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Proponents of IV wellness therapy claim taking nutrients intravenously rather than orally is advantageous because 100 per cent of the elements go into the system, quickly rehydrating, replenishing nutrients and restoring the body to peak balance. Nutrients taken orally are subject to the absorption barrier in the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore larger amounts are needed in order to achieve a similar result via IV or intramuscular supplementation.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I’m a bit shocked and surprised that this kind of service has been introduced to Hong KongAnfernee Yim Kin-ming</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics remain unconvinced, arguing there is no evidence from properly controlled trials of the benefits of these vitamin infusions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m a bit shocked and surprised that this kind of service has been introduced to Hong Kong,” says Dr Anfernee Yim Kin-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong College of Emergency Medicine’s intensive care subcommittee. “The problem is there is no concrete evidence to support the use of IV fluids to boost immunity, for anti-ageing or other therapeutic use. It’s not really evidence-based medicine.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yim, a specialist in emergency medicine and intensive care medicine, says the use of IV fluids is for saving lives rather than promoting health. He calls it “strange” that IV therapy providers do not provide detailed ingredients and dosage information of their infusions. He also questions how such medical treatments are regulated in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The first rule of toxicology is ‘the dose makes the poison’,” says Yim. “Anything can be poison – depending on how much you get of it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sharie Ross, Reviv HK director, says her clinic has a licence for a Hong Kong medical doctor in private practice, but declines to provide the doctor’s name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The doctor does not sit in the Reviv HK clinic. The only medical professionals there are a team of nurses headed by Sarah Chiguer, who has more than six years’ experience as a staff nurse in intensive care units at hospitals in Paris and London. The nurses ensure patients first complete a medical screening questionnaire and undergo vital-sign checks before getting any treatment.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">In most cases, nothing dangerous or risky will happen; we just want to be as safe as possibleSarah Chiguer</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are some cases where patients are referred to the doctor for further consultation prior to treatment. These could be patients with cancer, diabetes and those with particular heart conditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We keep the highest standards possible,” says Chiguer. “In most cases, nothing dangerous or risky will happen; we just want to be as safe as possible. We want to make sure the treatment you’re coming in for is beneficial for you.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At Dr Lauren Bramley & Partners, Mui turns away women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with certain allergies or on certain medications, those with vein problems and heart conditions, among others. “That’s why it is important to have a medical consultation with a qualified medical doctor prior to getting IV therapy,” says Mui.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taking vitamins via IV rather than orally began some 40 years ago when John Myers, a physician from Baltimore in the US invented the Myer’s Cocktail as an alternative treatment to relieve chronic pain and fatigue, asthma, muscle spasms, upper respiratory infections, seasonal allergies, migraines, and a host of other conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/08/01/feb10230-5477-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_486x.JPG?itok=6TXSZeDE">But it is only in recent years that IV nutrient therapy has been used as an elective treatment for wellness and health maintenance. Las Vegas was reportedly the original hot spot for such IV therapy, where in April 2012 Dr Jason Burke, a certified anaesthesiologist, launched his IV clinic Hangover Heaven, a medical service in a bus that picks up and treats patients suffering from “hangovers, whether it be from alcohol, stress, or life in general”.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">IVs always carry some, albeit small, risk of bruising, clotting, bleeding and infection, which eating, obviously, does notDr David Katz</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reviv, started by four emergency room physicians, first hit Miami in 2012, then branched out to Las Vegas, inside the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino, in August that year. There are now more than 25 Reviv clinics across four continents: in the US, UK, continental Europe, Africa, Canada, Hong Kong and soon Australia and the Middle East.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clinical data for the efficacy of IV therapy remains sparse. Dr David Katz, director of Yale University’s Prevention Research Centre, conducted a trial of the Myer’s cocktail for fibromyalgia, a disorder characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. The results were not definitive; there was a trend toward improvement with both the active treatment and IV placebo, but they did suggest a beneficial effect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an article on the popular health website DoctorOz.com, Katz notes that putting nutrients directly into the bloodstream “invites an array of potential dangers”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says: “Digestion regulates the speed at which nutrients enter the blood – IV dosing eliminates that safeguard. IVs always carry some, albeit small, risk of bruising, clotting, bleeding and infection, which eating, obviously, does not... If intravenous nutrients do have the power to act like ‘medicine’, then they have the power to do harm as well. Those two things come as a package, inevitably. So it makes sense to proceed with caution.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: trickle-down effect</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2aalZbCtcWOmqmtoZOhsnB9mHJtbWtjZLWwusakpqeflafAbrTOqKKenF2ew26w0aKnrGWmnsGiucinqmaZnpl6qcXDq5itoZ%2BjeqW7jK2fnrE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./538756-lawyer-nicole-fegans-bio-law-school-husband-clients.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lawyer Nicole Fegan bio: Law school, husband, and past clients">&larr;
