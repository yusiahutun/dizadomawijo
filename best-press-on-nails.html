Enter: press-on nails. While these nail enhancements may seem a little fussy to apply, they can last much longer than a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>basic manicure</a>. The dizzying array of designs gives you endless options to customize your look (even if you’re not especially talented at nail art). And as a bonus, you can even reuse press-on nails for a manicure that lasts and lasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, you might be a little wary of press-on nails if it’s a new style for you — especially since the removal process can damage your nails if you’re not careful. We <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tested</a> over a dozen sets to see which truly “nailed” it — rating each set of nails on a scale of 1 to 5 in a few categories: Ease of use, overall look, glue strength, and the integrity of their natural nails post-removal. These were the best press-on nails we tried.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-paint-lab-press-on-nails></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paint Lab Press-On Nails</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paint Lab Press-On Nails" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/o8oEvCBZ6LIOZIxK5rqMek_3D4k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paint-lab--wild-ones-3637880099554aff9fb5d680db045f9e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paint Lab</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These press-ons fit comfortably on any nail bed and come in countless designs.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The nails are thick and sturdy, which can make filing and shaping time-consuming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For comfortable, long-lasting nails, we found PaintLab’s offerings to be the best press-on nails we tested. PaintLab’s press-ons come in a variety of designs — like swirls, cherries, smileys, and more — so it’s easy to find a set that matches your aesthetic. And the application process couldn’t be easier. “The press-ons fused to my natural nails really well,” our tester shares. The best part is that once they’re on, they don’t even look like fake nails. Our tester says their nails looked professionally painted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The nails themselves are sturdy, which is a good thing when it comes to staying power.

The Magic Press Solid Color sets from Dashing Diva are perfect for achieving simple salon-quality <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gel manicures</a> in seconds. A must-have for someone with a penchant for barely-there, nude nails, these customizable press-ons make for an easy, high-gloss mani without the use of any UV light. There's no need for glue, either: You can pop these on your natural nails and head out the door with no muss or fuss. Not only are they easy to apply, but they look convincingly real. "The nails look amazing on my fingers," our tester admits. "I'd prefer applying these over going to a salon and getting my nails done."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the lack of glue, the tester explains that the adhesive felt strong in the lab setting. However, if you tend to be rougher on your hands or spend a lot of time in the sink, you might want to consider another option. After several hand washes, it's safe to assume that the adhesive will eventually give, and you may lose a nail or two.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Nails: </strong>30 nails in 12 sizes | <strong>Adhesive Included: </strong>Double-sided nail tabs | <strong>Extras:</strong> Prep pad, nail file, cuticle stick</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designs-chillhouse-chill-tips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designs</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chillhouse Chill Tips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chillhouse Chill Tips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/t39F7sHERXWF6WuYAT3RhWwlMjw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign52-ace343df77cb498c8e41ad938d455522.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chillhouse</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These press-on nails have unique designs that rival professional nail artists' creations.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Testers found the glue to be a little too sticky and difficult to remove.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As far as designs are concerned, press-on nails have really evolved. Back when I was dipping my fingers into the world of fake nails, I could only really find plain pinks and reds. While there's nothing wrong with a simple, one-tone manicure, a set with nail art that looks like it was done at a salon is unmatched — especially now that quirky graphics, psychedelic swirls, and colorful tips are all the rage. Constantly heading to the salon for a new design can get pricey, though, so I'm thankful that Chillhouse offers tons of designs for a fraction of the cost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there was one thing we could change about the Chillhouse Chill Tips, it would be the glue. It works well in adhering the faux nails to natural nails, but when it comes in contact with the skin, it gets super sticky. "The nails were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>easy to apply</a>, but the glue was tacky when it got on my fingers," our tester shares. "When I removed the press-on nails, I found that there was some residue left on my natural nails, too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Nails: </strong>24 nails | <strong>Adhesive Included: </strong>Glue | <strong>Extras:</strong> Dual-sided buffer, cuticle stick</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Person sorting the Chillhouse Chill Tips press-on nails to put them on" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sVfMB0ocJnz3qF1KqV9mmpE_6lM=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chillhouse-press-on-nails-tamara-staples-04.jpg-4c8501e0e1d5424eac8b3a40dec1e812.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Person filing their nails next to a box of Chillhouse Chill Tips Reusable Press-On Nails" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/X6RilCOgj3016HleLBnaMKJpqpg=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chillhouse-press-on-nails-tamara-staples-14.jpg-5cb92f6e1ef045c7a99caeab93d3b256.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-lasting-static-nails-reusable-pop-on-manicure></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Lasting</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Static Nails Reusable Pop-On Manicure</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Static Nails Reusable Pop-On Manicure" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OthTIj9E5mz2dMm-VCxPsqXE3nY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Static-Nails-Reusable-Pop-On-Manicure-bcb7643cc4d344648886ef4c2afc93a9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> You get your money's worth with these press-on nails that can be reapplied, re-shaped, and even re-painted.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> We wish the kit came with a manicure stick to help with the application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in a variety of lengths, designs, and colors, selecting a set from Static Nails is comparable to choosing a shade of polish from the wall at the nail salon — it can feel impossible to pick just one. Once you do, though, the possibilities are endless. Each set can be reused, re-shaped, and even re-painted. Best of all: These nails have some serious staying power. "I wore the nails when doing laundry and washing dishes, and to my shock, they stayed on," the tester says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tester also shares that the nails look very natural. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Julie Kandalec</a>, a professional nail artist whose work has graced the fingertips of celebs like Sydney Sweeney, Mariah Carey, and Jessica Chastain, explains that to ensure your press-on manicure looks as convincing as possible, the nail's edge should match up with your cuticle line. "Not filing this area is a tell-tale sign that the nails you're wearing are fake," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note: the kit comes with everything you'll need for application except a wooden manicure stick. It's not a big deal, but you may need to use your fingers to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>push back your cuticles</a> before putting on any glue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Nails of Nails: </strong>24 nails in 12 sizes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Adhesive Included: </strong>Glue | <strong>Extras:</strong> Dual-sided buffer</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-kit-olive--june-press-on-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Kit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olive & June Press-On System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olive &amp;amp; June Press-On System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x6-Ti3hkpwPrVmPAn2Jr_VgthM0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign50-9046b09c0348454ca6b8a76bf61adb71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Olive & June</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This kit includes everything you'll need for a full-fledged salon-quality manicure.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The nails look a little fake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While all you need for a gorgeous-looking faux manicure is nails, glue, and a little patience, the Olive & June Press-On System convinced one of our testers that extras (like a nail clipper, dual-grit nail file, pro-grade nail buffer, and cuticle serum) make all the difference. Simply pick your favorite press-ons, which are made with 94 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, and let Olive & June supply the rest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The kit comes with a full set of nails, but when you're inevitably ready to switch things up, you can buy a new design for just $10 without repurchasing the entire kit. Don't discard nails you've already worn, though, because they can be reused, too. Once you're ready to take the nails off, all you have to do is follow the simple instructions on the removal kit. (Tip: After gently removing the press-ons, be sure to use the nail strengthener to reverse any damage that may have occurred.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the nails are made from recycled plastic, they don't exactly look like real nails, but that didn't seem to bother the tester. "The tips are sturdy. Plus, the designs are pretty and have a nice glossy finish," they say. "Do they look real? Absolutely not, but who cares? They're fun!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Nails: </strong>42 nails in 21 sizes | <strong>Adhesive Included: </strong>Glue | <strong>Extras:</strong> Carry-all pouch, file, buffer, prep pad, cuticle pusher, clipper, cuticle serum, nail strengthener, removal system</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-nails-manime></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Nails</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ManiMe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mani Me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LLYka_N018Vbu-CE7mdpQdjBN4w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign51-69b7c97f9296477694fb6c40b411935e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ManiMe</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These gel nail stickers are custom-made to fit your nails.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> They don't last as long as other options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Press-on might not be the best choice for you if you have damaged fingernails. According to Kandalec, sometimes your nails just need a break to "allow new, virgin nails to grow." If you think your nails need some time to chill, skip the glue and press-ons and opt for nail stickers instead. The ManiMe nail stickers differ from others because they're custom-made to fit your nails: The site guides you to take five photographs of your hands, and from there they create stickers that are made uniquely for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you receive them, the application process is super simple — all you have to do is press the stickers onto your fingernails and file them to your desired length. And, thanks to the fact that there's no glue involved, it's easy to correct mistakes. "After I realized I put one of the stickers upside down, it was easy to just peel it off and try again," the tester explains. "The longer the stickers sat on my nails, the more bonded they became, but my fingernails didn't look damaged post-removal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand says that the gel nail stickers will last up to 10 days, and for the most part, they did. "The nails stayed put after multiple rounds of washing with warm water and even a shower," the tester shares. "No water seeped underneath, which really surprised me." If you're someone who uses your hands a lot or tends to rough up a normal manicure, you should keep in mind that these are just stickers and they may become damaged after a few days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Nails: </strong>15 nail stickers | <strong>Adhesive Included: </strong>Stickers | <strong>Extras:</strong> Prep pad, nail file</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Size and Fit: </strong>When it comes to press-on manicures, size matters. In fact, how each fits on your nail actually determines how long the press-on mani will last. "Make sure to pick a press-on nail that matches your nail bed size and curvature," Kandalec advises. If you're in between sizes, choose one size larger and then file down the sides so it hugs your natural nail. “Press-ons can come off easily if they don’t fit right. But, when applied correctly, they can last you up to two weeks,” she says.</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> According to Kandalec, you should always clean your nails with 91 to 99 percent alcohol before applying your press-ons, and use a pea-sized amount of nail glue on your natural nails. "Don't press too hard when applying," she warns. Doing so will cause the adhesive to seep out from the sides and dry along the cuticle line, which will make the nails look fake and crusty.</li><li><strong>Removal:</strong> Press-ons can be applied with nail glue or double-sided sticker tabs. If your press-ons were applied with nail glue, the fastest way to remove them is to trim down the length as much as possible, use a coarse grit nail file to rough up the surface of the nail and then soak them in pure acetone. As for double-sided nail tabs, Kandalec explains that the soaking method can actually make the adhesive even stickier. Instead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>she suggests</a> using a paintbrush dipped in acetone to loosen the edges of the nail before gently pulling them off. Then, to remove the sticker, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>roll it off</a> using your thumb.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are press-on nails?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Press-on nails are artificial nails that are made of acrylic resin, gel, or most commonly, ABS plastic. They are sold blank and ready to paint, or already painted with nail polish, gems, studs, or many other mediums. Press-on nails cover the entire nail bed, unlike the tips in the salon that adhere only to the tip of your nail and are covered with acrylic or gel by a salon pro. Some press-on nails, like those from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Static Nails</a>, can even be re-shaped, re-applied, and re-painted.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply press-on nails?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Before applying your press-ons, make sure you trim or file your polish-free natural nails short so the free edge doesn't show," Kandalec explains. "Then, lightly buff your nails to improve adhesion and swipe them with 91 to 99 percent isopropyl alcohol." After you've chosen all 10 nails and shaped them to fit perfectly, cover each fingernail with glue (one at a time). For best results, try aligning the press-on along the cuticle line and applying each one at a downward angle, pressing firmly for 20-30 seconds. "If any glue seeps from the sides, remove it right away with a cuticle stick dipped in acetone," she adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you care for your nails after removing press-ons?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Always make sure to remove your press-on nails correctly. Improper removal (like ripping them off) can lead to brittle, damaged nails. Kandalec says that after you soak your nails off, be gentle with them for a few hours. "Apply a hydrating cuticle oil and hand cream to replenish the skin after removal since acetone can be drying," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a> is a commerce writer for InStyle, where she covers all things beauty and fashion.
