Kendrick Sampson, who played one of the show's main members, has gained a lot of fame and attention<strong> </strong>through all his hard work.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The fans of the handsome hunk actor are eager to learn more about his dating life. They frequently question his dating life, such as if he is gay or has a girlfriend.</p><p>Keep scrolling to know all the answers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is&nbsp;Kendrick Sampson Gay?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Fame comes with a lot of rumors. Especially a private person like Kendrick, who doesn't really talk about his dating life, gets involved in gay rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Kendrick is not gay, and the rumors&nbsp;started when he did not talk about his dating life and supported the LGBTQIA+ community.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Explore:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Openly Gay Actor Nicco Annan Talks about His Portrayal In P-Valley</a></p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TeenVouge</a>, the Insecure actor was asked about masculinity and gender. He acknowledged being a feminist and shared his viewpoint on weakness, which stated that for men, it denoted either feminine or gay.</p><p>Moreover, the fact that he is not that open about his love life involving a woman has resulted in some people speculating him to be on the gay side, but those rumors prove to be just a misunderstanding as he has clarified in interviews that he likes girls.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Kendrick Sampson Single or Already Has a&nbsp;Girlfriend?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Kendrick is one good-looking guy, and he surely has been able to attract many women and men towards him. But he has not revealed any details about his girlfriend, and thus, one might assume that he is single.</p><p><strong>Kendrick Sampson has not revealed much about his love life. (Photo:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glamour</a>)</strong></p><p>During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glamour</a>, back in November 2015, when he was asked about his relationship status and his ideal girlfriend, he said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;"I am single and probably will be for a while. I love a woman who is passionate about something bigger than herself, whatever that is."</p><p>He then continued,</p><p>"Humor is a must because I laugh at everything. I'd love a woman who pursues peace, loves kids, isn't afraid of conflict, and effectively communicates. Someone who loves God and loves great food. That's my life. Oh, and has to be able to cook at least as well as me!"</p><p>Now, this makes things much clearer regarding his choice.&nbsp;</p><p>However, two years later, Kendrick was rumored to be dating Fifth Harmony's Normani Kordei.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>They were first seen together at Variety's Power of Young Hollywood party in 2017. They were spotted flirting and exchanging phone numbers. But, they were never seen together again after that.</p><p><strong>Learn About:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Genevieve Nnaji Is Waiting for Her Soulmate!</a></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After a year, Kendrick was seen with supermodel Naomi Campbell. They were spotted together at Burberry's Christmas party in 2018.</p><p>After they appeared together on the cover of British Vogue in 2019, rumors about their relationship began to surface.</p><p>However, in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Vogue</a>, Kendrick shared how he clicked instantly with Naomi. But he did not share anything about their dating speculations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As of now, Kendrick seems to be focusing more on his career rather than his love life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kendrick Sampson's Career</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Kendrick Smith Sampson was born on March 8, 1998, in Houston, Texas, USA.
