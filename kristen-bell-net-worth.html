At an early age Bell fell in love&nbsp;early with acting. At age 11 she was cast in a role for a local theater production of&nbsp;Raggedy Ann and Andy. Then, with the help of her mother, she found an agent began performing regularly through private school. She later attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts to major in musical theater.&nbsp;</p>American actress, singer, and producer <strong>Kristen Bell</strong> has an estimated net worth of <strong>$50 million dollars</strong>, as of 2023. Bell made her Broadway stage debut in the early 2000s as Becky Thatcher in the comedy musical The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.<p>To be an actress was the ultimate goal of school, so when she earned the role of Becky Thatcher in the Broadway musical&nbsp;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, she decided to drop out just four credits shy of graduation. The next year, when she was 22, she appeared on Broadway again, this time alongside Liam Neeson and Laura Linney in The Crucible.</p><p>Kristen Bell’s mother, Lorelei, helped establish her with an agent so she could audition for movie roles. By 1998, she had her first movie role, though uncredited, in Polish Wedding, which was locally filmed. Just before her freshman year of high school, Bell’s parents moved her from the public school system to Shrine Catholic High School, where she joined the drama and music clubs. This led to her starring as Dorothy Gale in the school’s production of The Wizard Of Oz in 1997, as well as appearing in many of the school’s other productions during her time there.</p><p>Kristen Bell graduated from Shrine Catholic High School in 1998, the same year as her role in Polish Wedding. Soon after, she moved to New York City to major in musical theater at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. She left in 2001, only a few credits off graduating, after having landed a role as Becky Thatcher in Broadway’s musical version of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer.</p><p>This musical was fairly short lived, but the same year she landed her first credited movie debut in Pootie Tang, unfortunately her only line was cut and she appeared only in a credit sequence scene.</p><p>Kristen Bell first began to earn money from her acting before her role in Veronica Mars. However, as with her acting career, her role as Veronica really began her road to wealth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>After working so hard to get to this point, Bell began to become more and more well known. Without a doubt, most of Kristen Bell’s net worth, an estimate of between eight to twenty million U.S. dollars, comes from her acting and all the work she did towards it. After Veronica Mars, Bell shot up to celebrity status and became pretty much a household name. With roles in award winning movies and other acting jobs, as well as winning awards herself, it’s understandable as to why the star has become so wealthy.</p><p>Known for being approachable, witty, and unfazed by Hollywood, Bell quickly found more work. She earned a recurring role on the hit series&nbsp;Heroes&nbsp;and a healthy feature film career, most visibly in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Couples Retreat and When in Rome. &nbsp;</p><p>And through her films deal frequently with multiple men and/or loves, in real life she’s a “serial monogamist”—after ending a five-year relationship with former fiancé Kevin Mann in 2007, she started dating actor and comedian Dax Shepherd. The two were engaged in early 2011. &nbsp;</p><p>Most of Bell’s big-screen work has been romantic comedy based, but she is the first to say she doesn’t want to be pigeonholed as such. After lighting up Broadway, cult stardom on television and headlining movies, it remains to be seen just how far the Midwestern girl with the California looks can go.</p><p>Kristen Bell has worked hard to achieve everything she has, and continues to be driven and successful. She is admired and respected for her ability to remain humble and genuinely grateful for the things she has in her life, as well as for being a loving wife and mother.</p><p>Her work in charity, as well as her incredible acting skills, sense of humor and her attitude towards mental health and other issues make her an incredible role model, and Bell continues to be successful because she is hard working and down to earth, never being selfish with the money she makes, and using her platform to spread positivity, all while continuing to invest herself fully into her acting and her other projects.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kristen_Bells_Total_Net_Worth></span>Kristen Bell’s Total Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Today the award winning actress has spread her wings and is also a director, producer, singer and author. Her voice became world famous for her roles in Disney’s Frozen and Zootopia, as well as in theater, television, web series and even video games.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>Some of her highest paying movies have been, Hit and Run, Queenpins, Movie 43, The Boss, Bad Moms, among others. Her highest paying TV series, have been Gossip Girl, Heroes, The Good Place, Veronica Mars, and most recently, The Woman in the House.</p><p>For her role in Gossip Girl, Bell was reportedly paid&nbsp;$125,000 per episode&nbsp;of the show. She seems to have been paid a little less for earlier seasons. For the 121 episodes of Gossip Girl in total, Kristen will have likely earned around $12 million.</p><p>From all of her acting appearances, Kristen Bell has appeared in over 100 separate films and TV series, as well as all of her producing, and the more than 200 appearances that she has made as herself. It is estimated that she has earned a total of $55 million dollars during her career. Her tax rate on that will have been around 46%, making her after-tax earnings $29.7 million, having paid $25.3 million in taxes.</p><p>Kristen Bell married <a data-ail=10500 href=#>Dax Shepard</a> in 2013 and they have stayed together. They have had two children together and appear very stable as a couple and also stable as individuals. Bell has worked with various charities, is a vegan and practices Transcendental Meditation, “I really enjoy powering down for 20 minutes because it’s like shutting off light switches in my brain” she has said.</p><p>While in 2016, Bell reportedly received some treatment for depression and anxiety. She also used her platform to help others, “It’s important for me to be candid about this so people in a similar situation can realize that they are not worthless and that they do have something to offer,” she said at the time.</p><p>Everything about Kristen Bell tells me that she is somebody who keeps a keen eye on her homelife, including her finances. She has likely invested some of her earnings in the stock market, as well as in property.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>In business, Bell and her husband founded the company Hello Bello in 2019. The company produces and markets plant-based baby care products which are designed to be environmentally friendly and affordable. In 2021, it was reported that annual revenue was $26.1 million a year with 104 employees. Kristen’s share is estimated to be worth $20 million dollars. There will have been investments of sums of her earnings of course, to reach the revenue figures that have produced this valuation.</p><p>Overall, Kristen Bell’s net worth may be as high as $50 million dollars.</p><h2 id=summing-up><span class=ez-toc-section id=Summing-Up></span>Summing-Up<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bell is respected for her mental health advocacy and her charity work, particularly with charities for animal rights. She is hard working and a kind person despite her success, and is therefore a well known name and a role model. She is praised for her sense of humor and down to earth personality, and is a fantastic actress.</p><p>Kristen Bell became rich and famous with hard work and dedication. Taking acting lessons from a young age and trying her best in all of her auditions and projects, combined with her university education in acting and musical theater led her into a prosperous career and life with her husband, Dax Shepard, and two children. Her big break was her lead role as Veronica in the TV show Veronica Mars, which led to many future roles, though she had plenty of previous acting experience.</p><p>“There are so few strong roles for women, especially young women. And Veronica is very serious but also very likable. She’s a lone wolf, and it appeals to people that she isn’t rich and doesn’t have a lot of friends. No posse. She’s just like you, like most of us,” Kristen Bell has said. She has starred in TV shows, movies, web series, commercials and music videos, and has experience in directing from her work on television show, The Good Place.</p><p>She is known to help others through her work as a mental health advocate. Using her platform she has spoken out about her struggles with mental health. She also work with charities for animal rights and according to <a href=#>Insider</a> Kristen Bell has been a vegetarian since she was just 11 years old. Then, in 2012, she became a vegan apparently&nbsp;after watching “Forks Over Knives,” a documentary about degenerative diseases and their connection to eating animal-based foods.</p><p>She has founded a business from which her share is estimated to be worth around $20 million. All the while she continues to be successful in her acting career, winning many awards including a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsZeau6rB0meaqKVfoL%2Bqv9OepWaalaG5brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mariah-carey-discusses-rules-locked-away-first-marriage-tommy-mottola.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mariah Carey's candid marriage confession: 'I was locked away'">&larr;
