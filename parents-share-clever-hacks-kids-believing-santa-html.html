However, it's important to remember that you need to be just as excited.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your kids are always watching what you're doing and how you react to stuff. So, when you're in the mall with your children and Santa's in the lobby, be just as excited as they are to see him so they really know he's real. &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anytime you see a Santa when you're out with your kids wherever it may be or if you’re talking to your children or partner about something Christmas related, act just as shocked and joyful as them.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not only will they think you’re in on all the excitement too, they'll think that you believe in Santa too.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold><span class="mol-style-large femail-ccox">13.
