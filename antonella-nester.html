They enjoyed seeing her cheery grin and hearing her lovely voice. She had been with the show for a long time and was a well-known face. Unfortunately, things began to change following the Coronavirus pandemic. Because the corporation revealed that it did not have enough revenue, numerous hosts, including her, were let go. Antonella’s fans and she herself expressed their dismay, but there was nothing they could do.</p><h3><span id=Cancer_Struggle>Cancer Struggle</span></h3><p>Antonella Nester is now battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer.
