But the star’s acting skills were put to the test when he decided to arrange the mother of all surprise parties for <a class=hm-link href=#>his wife Liz</a> to celebrate her 40th birthday.</p><h2>Kelvin Fletcher's surprise for wife Liz</h2><p id=eYSJr-Vg20 data-wc=116>Unbeknownst to Liz, Kelvin had spent days secretly transforming the family’s 120-acre farm into a fabulous festival site, complete with fun fair games, a 100-foot inflatable assault course with ball pits and slides, a stone-fired pizza stand and a tepee strewn with twinkling fairy lights and haybales. "I would be sneaking out to mow the fields and put the tepee up until one in the morning," Kelvin, 39, tells <strong></strong>as the couple, who are parents to Marnie, seven this month, Milo, four, and 15-month-old twins Maximus and Mateusz, exclusively share photos from the special day with us. "I'd tell Liz I was checking on the sheep – but my excuses were getting thinner and thinner."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5d3baf9c31c7-liz-fletcher-tears-40th-birthday-surprise.jpg><p id=esmc5SS0ij data-wc=4></p><p id=ec8HDRN2vrY data-wc=60>Thankfully, he pulled it off with flying colours, gathering around 80 of their closest family and friends for an unforgettable party – much to the astonishment of his actress wife. "I had no idea," Liz, who turned 40 on 13 July, tells us. "To see all these faces I know stood there, it was the most overwhelming feeling: complete joy.”</p><p id=eVB8TiBZW7 data-wc=88>Kelvin had cleverly sent Liz on a spa weekend with a friend to get her out of the house while he put the final touches on the festival scene, and guests began arriving. On her return, he met Liz in their driveway and led her towards the field down a literal memory lane, which he had lined with photographs of their life together. Then, they were met by the waiting crowd, which included their four excited children. When she realised what was going on, Liz cried with joy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kelvin's secret plan</h2><p id=emSflLdh1q data-wc=103>"Everywhere I turned, I saw people I hadn’t seen for ages and I think that's what made me so emotional," she says. "It felt so special that everyone had made the effort to come." Kelvin had let Marnie and Milo in on the surprise the day before. "I said: 'Guys, I’ve got a secret to tell you…' I explained we’re going to do a surprise party for Mummy and we can’t tell her anything. Milo kept saying: 'Well, I’ll just tell her a little bit'. But they took it in their stride, and they didn’t give the game away. They were really excited."</p><p id=ejhMT-N3Qs data-wc=82>Festival-goers – including their farmer neighbour Gilly Storer and Kelvin’s Emmerdale co-star Chris Bisson, who plays Jai Sharma on the ITV soap – were well fed and watered, with a drinks trailer serving wine and local gins, and pizzas being freshly made. Telling us about his highlight of the party, Kelvin says: "At the end of the day, pretty much everyone had gone, and the heavens had opened but we just danced. For a moment, it was like winding the clock back."</p><h2>Life on the farm</h2><p id=eupj4rgU90 data-wc=69>Since upping sticks and moving their family from Manchester to the beautiful Cheshire countryside in February 2021, <a class=hm-link href=#>Kelvin and Liz have become intent on sharing a slice of their good life</a> with those around them. They have an ever-expanding menagerie of animals on the farm, including their pet cava pooch on Ginger and a whole host of sheep, alpacas, horses, rare breed pigs, chickens and a herd of cattle.</p><p id=e-4PilJ7NQ data-wc=54>The family are nearing the end of filming for their new docuseries on ITV, following the success of on BBC1. "It’ll be a nice glimpse into the ups and downs of farming,” explains Kelvin. “There’s idyllic moments but there’s also the chaos of having a young family."</p><p id=exFbdCqqy0_ data-wc=4></p><p id=eW45qzrb8qr data-wc=41></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
