I have such a deep love for him,” said Mylchreest.</p><h2><strong>Who plays Lady Danbury in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUEENCHARLOTTE_105_Unit_04976RC.jpg><p>Relatively unknown Arsema Thomas (full name: Arséma Angela Adeoluwayemi Thomas) will play young Agatha Danbury, who educates the new queen in the expectations and norms of London society, while also finding her own confidence and identity.</p><p>Thomas was born in&nbsp;Atlanta, Georgia&nbsp;to Ethiopian and Nigerian diplomats and owing to her parents’ work, she grew up across the&nbsp;Comoros, Uganda, Kenya, Togo and Benin, and India.&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, she speaks several languages other than English, including French, Spanish,&nbsp;Yoruba&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amharic.</p><p>After signing with her agent in South Africa, she made her screen debut as Rebecca in&nbsp;Redeeming Love in 2022.

In April 2022, Gemmell told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Town & Country magazine</a>, “I think love is important. I think respect is important, and I think without those, it’s a very difficult world. I’m also not naive to believe that they’re easily obtained or that that road is not paved with difficulties, because it can be and has been, and most of us have been heartbroken. But we have more options at our fingertips than perhaps Violet would’ve or her children, so it’s a different world. But I believe in love, definitely.
