He was questioned about the visit he had taken more than a week ago to see his dad, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, after the monarch revealed he had been diagnosed with a form of cancer. Now, <a href=#>royal</a> commentator and podcast host Kinsey Schofield has revealed she believes he was “caught off guard” by the interviewer.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-caught-off-guard-by-being-asked-about-the-royals>Harry ‘caught off guard’ by being asked about the royals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2014051141-810x1024.jpg><p>Schofield appeared on TalkTV to discuss Prince Harry’s Good Morning America interview and revealed she believed he hadn’t expected to be asked about his family back in the UK or King Charles.</p><p>She began: “I think we might be giving this interview too much credit.</p><p>“I think that Harry seemed caught off guard by some of the questions, and tried to stay positive but wrap it all back to comes to Invictus Games. I think he was nice about his family and he was positive about his family, and that’s great.</p><p><strong>HEARTBREAKING: </strong><a href=#>Prince William’s heartbreaking confession over Harry feud goes viral – ‘I’m sad about that’</a></p><p>“But I don’t think that this is moving us in any specific direction when it comes to reconciliation.”</p><p>After one of the hosts suggested it was <a href=#>Prince William</a> who was the one who “doesn’t trust” Harry or his wife, Scholfield confirmed she had been hearing from sources the king’s eldest would “not allow” Harry to return to The Firm “in any capacity.”</p><p>“There is one huge obstacle in Harry’s way and that’s Prince William when it comes to reconciliation, or even this conversation about Harry stepping in and <a href=#>helping the king out on a temporary basis</a>. I’m hearing that Prince William will not allow Prince Harry to return in any capacity.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-ve-messed-up>‘They’ve messed up’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2008849492-1024x739.jpg><p>She then pointed out a Daily Mail article <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which claims</a> the sovereign feels a similar way.</p><p>Kinsey continued: “I think they’ve messed up,” Schofield continued, talking about Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>.</p><p>“You know, actions speak louder than words and Harry and Meghan have become a liability based on the choices they’ve made.</p><p>“They don’t seem to consider the consequences of their actions.</p><p>“They make rash decisions, and they make very selfish decisions based on what’s going to improve their life at the moment, and I don’t think that’s the life of service,” she concluded.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-good-morning-america-interview>Prince Harry’s Good Morning America interview</h2><p>During the interview, the Duke of Sussex was supposed to be discussing the Invictus Games, but he was asked about King Charles and the rest of his family back in the UK. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Looking uncomfortable and giving clipped answers</a>, the Duke of Sussex was also asked about his children, Archie, four, and Lilibet, two.</p><p>“I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go and see him as soon as I could,” he told the interviewer when asked how he heard about his dad’s diagnosis and “what he did next.”</p><p>“Look, I love my family, and the fact that I was able to get on a plane and go see him and spend any time with him, I’m grateful for that,” he said in response to how the 25-hour visit had been for him “emotionally.” He added how he views his dad’s diagnosis “stays between me and him.”</p><p>He was then asked about the “unifying effect” Charles’ illness could have and if it was possible.</p><p>Harry replied: “Yeah, I’m sure. Throughout all these families I see on a day-to-day basis, you know the strength of the family unit coming together.”</p><p>However, he was quick to remind the interviewer he “has his own family” after being asked how he is coping with being in a different country when this is all happening.</p><p>The Duke continued: “My family and my life in California is as it is. You know, I’ve got other trips planned that will take me through the UK or back to the UK so I’ll stop in and see my family as much as I can.”</p><p><strong>OH NO: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry sent ‘clear message’ by King Charles, royal expert says</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d9cLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaumqtdmK62s8etZKielmK0tq3RnWSwoJmhsm7AwKWioqaXYq6ju9StZKGho2KzornIpbBmoZ5itK6tjKKlrZ2iq7amw44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shaheen-jafargholi-and-amy-leigh-hickman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shaheen Jafargholi and Amy-Leigh Hickman">&larr;
