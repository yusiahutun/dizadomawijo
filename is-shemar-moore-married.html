Shemar beat out over 300 men who were also auditioning for the part. After playing on the soap for over a decade, he landed the role of Derek Morgan on the police crime drama Criminal Minds, which he acted on for 11 seasons and left only to star on his own show. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He was cast in 2017 to play the lead role on <a href=#>S.W.A.T.</a> as Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson, a police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. After serving as a patrolman for six years, he becomes a member of the S.W.A.T. team.</p><p>The actor has won quite a few distinguished awards for his roles. Shemar won eight Image Awards while on the Young and the Restless and Criminal Minds, in addition to the 2000 Daytime Emmy Award for being an Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It’s hard to believe that a heartthrob like Shemar has never been married.

Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's the reason why Shemar Moore is not married.</h2><p>The actor and model has made women swoon for decades on both the big and small screen, but he is not married and has never been married. The star has been linked to quite a few famous women over the years, however, including Anabelle Acosta, Halle Berry, and Toni Braxton.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, Shemar never took the next step in any of his relationships and got married. For all of those wondering why the 51-year-old is not married, it's because of his hectic work schedule. Shemar has openly spoken about loving his career, while also wanting to be a father and spend the rest of his life with a woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a>, he shared, "I need balance in my life. I love what I do for a living. I love it from 'action' to 'cut,' but I also want to walk my dogs, travel, get married, have kids. I want balance, and it's hard to do with the schedule that we have."&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, in an interview for Watch! magazine, Shemar also said that he wants to settle down. "I want to be a family man. I want to be a father, I want to have a partner in crime, a woman to share [my life] with," he said.</p><p>He added, "I want to continue to evolve, I want to continue to take the next step in my life. In my personal life."</p><p>And his wish is finally coming true! He and his girlfriend Jesiree are expecting a baby girl. In his gender reveal post, he wrote: "Here comes the BEST part of my life."</p><p>While he may not be a dad just yet, you can still catch Shemar and the rest of the S.W.A.T. cast in Season 6, which returns on January 13.</p><p>S.W.A.T. airs on Fridays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p>Latest <strong>S.W.A.T.</strong> News and Updates</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv8eepJqqXaK8sL7EZqSaqqKesqU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./golden-bachelor-garden-shed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See 'The Golden Bachelor' Star Theresa's Gorgeous Garden Shed">&larr;
