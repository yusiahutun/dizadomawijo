Somehow, I muster the bravado to perform a 360-degree twirl in front of him, my suddenly long and glossy hair swirling round my face and shoulders in a way that I hope might just look a little bit&nbsp;glamorous.</span><br></p><p><span>‘You look sweet, but it is a bit of a shock,’ says my partner.</span><br></p><p><span>Over dinner, helped along by a glass of wine or two, he does a lot of smiling. ‘Actually, you look lovely. Younger and more feminine.’</span><br></p><p><span>Extensions have made a dramatic difference to my look. As I place my hand to the nape of my neck and lift &nbsp;my hair to shake it free from my jacket collar, a small smile spreads across my face.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The action feels familiar and strange. I last had long hair like this when I was 21. It is 40 years since I had my then shoulder-length locks cut short, and in the intervening decades, I have never worn my hair below my chin.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/02/article-2383618-1B1F3D27000005DC-189_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Can you guess which of these blow-dries cost $40, and which...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384470-1B25C3C5000005DC-895_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>The best bristles: It doesn't matter what make-up you wear...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384433-1B24F344000005DC-154_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>She's rocking it!

A redhead, a blonde and a brunette, all mature, but also long-haired and lovely in their individual ways.</span></p><p><span>I wondered if Ian was right. Generally speaking, we women of a certain age, especially of the non-celebrity variety, tend to regard long hair as age inappropriate. We might just about get away with it shoulder-length, but anything longer is seen as trying too hard — and dangerously muttonish.</span><br><span>Like most women of my age, I want to look good, but I don’t want to appear desperate, vampish or remotely cougarish.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384425-1B12EE14000005DC-612_306x497.jpg height=497 width=306 alt="Before and after: In the space of just a few hours, I became the proud possessor of a luscious glossy mane about 6¿ or 7¿in longer than it was, and considerably fuller" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384425-1B130522000005DC-43_306x497.jpg height=497 width=306 alt="Before and after: In the space of just a few hours, I became the proud possessor of a luscious glossy mane about 6¿ or 7¿in longer than it was, and considerably fuller" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Before and after: In the space of just a few hours, I became the proud possessor of a luscious glossy mane about 6 or 7in longer than it was, and considerably fuller</p><p><span>Ian Carmichael went on to say that women today are less keen to wear their hair poker straight, ‘embracing movement and texture instead’.</span><br></p><p><span>I do think dead straight hair, especially if it’s long, does older women no favours. The natural gravity of ageing — that inevitable southward trajectory, particularly of the mouth and chin — is somehow emphasised by hair that hangs limply down the sides of the face.</span><br></p><p><span>The truth is that I hate my hair. All women have bad hair days, but my only good hair moment is the first 30 minutes after I’ve washed and&nbsp; blow-dried it.</span><br></p><p><span>No matter what products I use —and, believe me, I have used absolutely all of them — my hair is as flat as my singing voice.</span><br></p><p><span>It wasn’t always like this. In my teens, I had thick hair and a proper fringe, but since my 20s it’s been thinning and receding. I also have ‘intermittent telogen effluvium’ or abnormal shedding, which means it falls out sooner than it should.</span><br></p><h3 style=text-align:center class=wocc><span style=font-weight:700>DID YOU KNOW?</span><br></h3><p><span>Hair loss is often</span><span> linked to hormonal</span><span> changes, such as</span><span> the menopause</span><span></span></p><p><span>Though the hair loss is only temporary, in my case it results in less hair growing back slower than before. In addition, any major stress in my life makes the hair loss worse.</span><br><span>Last year I had major surgery to have my spleen removed and, three months later, my hair started falling out in handfuls.</span><br></p><p><span>I knew this was a recognised side-effect of general anaesthetic as it had happened to me once before but, a year on, my hair still hasn’t grown back fully. Volume and length have, sadly, become an elusive dream.</span><br></p><p><span>Ian Carmichael’s comments about older women looking good with longer hair gave me pause for thought, but I realised that, short of buying myself a hot, scratchy wig, there was only one way I was going to find out if I could wear my hair long and get away with it — and that was by having extensions.</span><br></p><p><span>I have to admit I have never thought of having them before. In fact, hair extensions have always made me think of WAGs, chavs and TOWIE, and I’ve read the horror stories about traction alopecia — bald spots caused by the over-tight braids used&nbsp; to attach extensions to real hair.</span><br></p><p><span>But when a colleague confesses to me that her full, natural-looking hair is mostly fake, thanks to strategic, discreet extensions, and says she knows just the person to help with mine, I can’t resist.</span><br></p><p><span>And so I come to be seated at Vixen and Blush, a salon in Clapham, South London, awaiting my fate at the hands of hairdresser Sarah McKenna, an extensions specialist. She says many varieties of hair can be used for extensions, but the minimum standard is Remy, a&nbsp; word that derives from the Indian word for root.</span><br></p><p><span>This is human hair that generally lasts much longer than other varieties, and stays shiny and tangle-free for longer.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384425-0DED827A00000578-752_634x381.jpg height=381 width=634 alt="Fears: I have to admit I have never thought of having them before.

In fact, hair extensions have always made me think of WAGs, chavs and TOWIE</p><p><span>The hair that Sarah will use on me is Russian Virgin — apparently, this is even better quality than Remy because each ponytail of hair comes from one girl.</span><br></p><p><span>At this point, I suddenly realise that a poor Russian girl with gorgeous hair probably sold her crowning glory for a song to&nbsp; satisfy the vanity of well-off women like me.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>‘The girl or her family won’t get a lot of money, but it’s probably worth a month’s wage and that means a lot to poorer families,’ says Sarah. ‘And, of course, her hair will grow again.’</span><br></p><p><span>I am about to receive the caviar of extension treatments. Sarah says hair from China and India is more affordable than Russian hair, but of inferior quality, and starts hand-mixing hair&nbsp; from different ponytails to match to my natural&nbsp; mid-brown hues.</span><br></p><p><span>She is using the well- established micro bond method on my hair, which involves attaching thin strands of extensions to a similar-sized section of my hair then bonding it with keratin resin that has been heated in a glue gun.</span><br></p><p><span>As for bald spots, Sarah insists they’re mostly caused by clip-in extensions worn day in, day out, which put pressure on the hair.&nbsp;</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384425-0D8C3BA6000005DC-640_306x461.jpg height=461 width=306 alt="Work it: Julianne Moore, 52, former and Susan Sarandon, 66- a redhead and a brunette, mature, but also long-haired and lovely in their individual ways" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384425-1B114BF6000005DC-983_306x461.jpg height=461 width=306 alt="Work it: Julianne Moore, 52, former and Susan Sarandon, 66- a redhead and a brunette, mature, but also long-haired and lovely in their individual ways" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Work it: Julianne Moore, 52, former and Susan Sarandon, 66- a redhead and a brunette, mature, but also long-haired and lovely in their individual ways</p><p><span>‘You should never sleep in clip-ons,’ she says. ‘And you should wear them twice a&nbsp; week at most.’</span><br><span>As each hair extension is applied, I experience a mild, but brief tugging sensation. Once the extensions are in place, Sarah cuts and tongs my hair into shape.</span><br></p><p><span>I feel nervous but excited, staring in the mirror at a woman who reminds me of my so-much-younger self. That’s because I’m not wearing my glasses, however.</span><br></p><p><span>When I put them on and move in closer to the mirror, I am shocked. Young hair, old face. Do I look like Pocahontas’s granny? A brunette Miss Piggy? The Wicked Witch of the West?</span><br></p><p><span>The transformation is dramatic, and I love my new hair. I would certainly challenge anyone to tell me it doesn’t look real.</span><br></p><p><span>But my one big fear is 16/61 syndrome: that I look 16 from the back with my glossy trailing locks and a slim figure that isn’t so different from when I was a girl, but that people will be shocked when they see a 61-year-old woman from the front.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/04/article-2384425-1B25B453000005DC-232_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Good investment?

In bed that night I can feel where the extensions are attached to my hair and getting to sleep is tricky, but the following morning I’m relieved to find my hair remains intact.</span><br></p><p><span>I drive to my sister’s house before she leaves for work and she gasps with surprise, but says she likes my extensions and can’t believe how authentic they look — and her mutton radar is even keener than mine.</span><br></p><p><span>When I pop into my local beauty salon, they fail to recognise me for a second, then give me the thumbs-up. ‘You’re acting differently,’ says Nicola the salon owner.</span><br></p><p><span>‘You’re touching your hair without realising it, in a flirty, girly way. It looks good, but a couple of inches shorter would be great.’</span><br></p><p><span>I meet a friend at the cafe round the corner, who says ‘I envy you’, and another friend tells me I look ten years younger.</span><br></p><p><span>When I had the extensions put in a few days ago, I thought I could easily have them removed if I felt foolish in&nbsp;them.</span><br></p><p><span>But as I go about my daily life — popping into the supermarket, walking the dog, attending a book launch, getting ready for a party — I feel as though I’ve been given an injection of energy-boosting vitamins. Yes, my new look has put a spring in my step.</span><br></p><p><span>At £480, it’s quite an investment (the extensions will need to be redone at the same cost in about three months), and it did require me to sit in a salon chair for three-and-a-half hours.</span><br></p><p><span>But compared to having regular Botox, a facelift or other rejuvenating techniques, all of which I have avoided, it’s less expensive and certainly less invasive.</span><br></p><p><span>For me, my new look has certainly scotched the myth that older women should go for the chop.</span><br></p><p><span>vixenandblush.com,&nbsp; tel: 020 7738 8388.</span><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6ScWttamVkpKa%2BxGarqKSUYrmwusZmn5qhomK6orfErGSwp52au26Aj2ajqKebYrmqt8RmpK6spKS7brDRnqqsnZRiuaK5wWZ5rqxdpb%2Bwu8Vme4iGhGK7prHDZpqurF2drqq%2BjKijnZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./young-thug-home-before-summer-scooter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Young Thug Will 'Be Home Before Summer,' Says Young Scooter">&larr;
