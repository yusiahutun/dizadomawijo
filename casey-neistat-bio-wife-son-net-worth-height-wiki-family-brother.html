His YouTube channel “Casey Neistat” has earned him millions of dollars through billions of viewers around the world. Today he is also known for his roles in the HBO series “The Neistat Brothers”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Casey Neistat Wiki/Biography, Family and Brother</strong></h2><p>Casey Neistat was born in Gales Ferry, Connecticut, USA, to parents Amy Neistat and Barry Neistat, with Van Neistat, Dean Neistat, and Jordan Neistat as siblings. Casey discovered his passion for filmmaking at a very early age, but the road to realizing his dream became difficult when he dropped out of school in year two at the age of 15. He never had the opportunity to return to school, instead, he took a job as a dishwasher in a seafood restaurant and as a short-term cook at the Mystic. When he was 20 years old, the YouTuber left Connecticut for New York City in search of greener pastures. He had an apartment a few blocks away from the World Trade Center in the Tribeca district and got his first job in the city as a bicycle courier.</p><p>In 2001, Neistat and his brother Van Neistat were hired by the artist Tom Sachs to collaborate on films about the artist’s sculptures. This seemed to be his first breakthrough in filmmaking – a dream he had long wanted to fulfill. Two years later, Neistat achieved his greatest breakthrough when his 3-minute short film, “Dirty Secret” on the iPod, attracted many viewers. This was his first announcement in the YouTube world after his TV series The Neistat Brother with his brother Van, which was later bought by HBO in 2008. This short video on the iPod also became controversial as it drew people’s attention to Apple’s policy on iPod battery replacement. In 2004, Casey worked with his brother Van to film the 15-minute science videos that were featured in the 59-minute Creative Mind video.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Barron Trump Height, Baby, Wiki, Mother, Family, Facts</a></strong></p><p>Beginning in 2010, Neistat began releasing more YouTube videos, including the video criticizing the MTA for its instructions on using emergency brake lines on the New York subway. The video made it into Time magazine’s top ten most creative videos of 2011; it also included the video about the Internet chat site Chatroulette and its offer of two-dollar bills to its fans. From 2010 to 2017, he had gained over 7 million fans. By the end of 2017, Neistat turned to YouTube blogging full-time and set out to become one of the top bloggers of his time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Casey Neistat Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Casey Neistat’s net worth is $15 million, an amount he has accumulated from his monetary videos on YouTube and from his career as a film director and producer. He made his first million in 2008 when he sold his show The Neistat Brothers to HBO. It was sold for 2 million dollars. He then began producing TV commercials for companies such as Google, Nike, and Mercedes-Benz, among many others. This eventually gave him the opportunity to promote his new VR and Galaxy S7 product launch at Oscar.</p><p>In addition to selling his show in 2008, the YouTube personality is said to have sold his company Beme to CNN Beme in 2016 in a $25 million deal. He did, however, create his YouTube channel, which is now considered one of the strongest and generates nearly $2.5 million a year. That is why he is mentioned as one of the most influential YouTubers in the world. His creative and always unique content and films have made him one of the best of his kind, and because he is honest in his commercials, his viewers are less concerned about advertiser-sponsored content.</p><p>Two of Casey Neistat’s most successful videos are the video Snowboarding With The NYPD with over 17 million views and Crazy German Water Park with over 20 million views. He has won two major awards to date – the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award 2011 and the YouTube Star of the Year Award 2016, and was also honored with the New Media Star Award at the GQ Men of the Year event. His YouTube audience is growing rapidly, reaching over 8 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wife, Son</strong></h2><p>Just as he discovered his passion for filmmaking at a young age, Casey’s love life also began at a young age. He had his first child, a son, Owen, at the age of 17 with his girlfriend at the time, Robin Harris. However, on 29 December 2013, he officially married his longtime girlfriend Candice Pool.</p><p>After he had his first child, Casey ran away to New York City with Pool and married her for the first time in 2005 in Houston, Texas. The marriage was short-lived and the two went their separate ways. He proposed to her again on a bridge in Amsterdam in 2013 and they were married in Cape Town, South Africa, Pool’s home country. They now have two children, including Francine, Casey’s first daughter with Pool.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Celestia Vega Bio, Age, Height, Family, Marriage, and Affairs</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height And Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>To his wealth and fame comes Casey Neistat, who is tall at 5′ 10″ (1.78 m) and has a body weight of about 170 lbs.
