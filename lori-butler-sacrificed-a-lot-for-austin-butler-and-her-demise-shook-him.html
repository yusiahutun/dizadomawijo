He loved her deeply because she raised him with love and was also one of the first people to believe in him.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though she is now best known for bringing Austin into the world, Lori also had a career in showbiz. She was an actress, and according to IMDb, she made a lot of appearances in TV series, including “My Sister Sam,” “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” and “The A-Team.”&nbsp;</p><p>On the big screen, she was known for playing Suzanne in “No Man’s Land” and herself in “Final Terror.” Lori’s love for acting was inherited by her son Austin Butler, and she helped him nurture it.&nbsp;</p><p>Lori enrolled her son in acting classes and drove him to his auditions. Ultimately, her sacrifices paid off, and Austin has never forgotten them. Not even after her demise.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Lori_Butlers_Death_Affect_Austin_Butler></span>How Did Lori Butler’s Death Affect Austin Butler?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin Butler’s mother, Lori Butler, died in September 2014 following an extended battle with cancer. He announced her death in a now-deleted tweet, calling her his hero and best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Her death affected him greatly, shaking him to the core and changing several aspects of his life. In 2022, Austin revealed that losing Lori made it easy for him to connect to the Elvis Presley character he played in the musical/drama film “Elvis” alongside Tom Hanks and Olivia DeJonge.</p><p>While preparing to take on the role, Austin had researched Elvis and found that the legend had also lost his mother in his early twenties. Elvis ultimately survived his mother dying, but Austin almost didn’t. Lori’s death devastated him, pushing him to question many things, including his career.</p><p>At some point, a heartbroken Austin even thought of leaving acting to help cancer patients. Fortunately, he did not go down that route. Instead, in honor of his late mother, he got a small number 27 tattoo on his left wrist.&nbsp;According to him, it was his mother’s lucky number. While she lived, she felt God looked out for her whenever she saw the number.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Lori_Butler_and_Her_Husband_Write_Austins_IMDb_Page></span>Did Lori Butler and Her Husband Write Austin’s, IMDb Page?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It was with pride that Lori Butler and her husband, Dave Butler, wrote an IMDb bio for Austin in 2007.&nbsp;Austin had been 16, and the biography was three paragraphs long. It revealed that&nbsp;Austin was born in Anaheim, California, and had always been a fan of movies as a child.&nbsp;</p><p>They wrote in the bio that he was 13 when someone approached him from a background-acting management company at the Orange County Fair. They said the agent ultimately helped him launch his career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Upon his first try, Austin fell in love with acting and started taking classes. Not long after, he bagged a somewhat permanent background-acting gig on Nickelodeon’s “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide” (2004).&nbsp;</p><p>Lindsey Shaw, a friend on the show, linked him up with her manager, who offered to represent him. According to the bio, it made Austin see himself as a serious actor.</p><p>The bio also mentioned his breakout role. It was revealed in 2007 because casting directors started recognizing him from his many audition attempts.&nbsp;</p><p>It made them decide to allow him to play the part of Jake Krandle in the Nickelodeon series “iCarly,” which started airing late in 2007. His first episode was called “iLike Jake,”‘ the bio concluded. The biography is now a little outdated, but Austin has kept it unchanged out of respect for his mother.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lori_Butlers_Daughter></span>Lori Butler’s Daughter&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin Butler is Lori’s most famous child, but he is not her only one. Lori also had a daughter named Ashley Butler. Her death also hit Ashley hard; the young woman has never forgotten her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>She reportedly pays sweet tributes and shares old photos of her late mother on social media to keep her memories alive. This made it clear that they shared a close bond while she lived.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Lori has passed on, her children have maintained a close relationship and are very supportive of each other. Austin had his sister tag along for the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> 2023 red carpet event.</p><p>Lori shares both her kids with her ex-husband David Butler. They lived in Anaheim, California, while raising their children. Lori worked in a daycare business while David was a commercial real estate appraiser.</p><p>They lived together for some years but ultimately divorced when Austin was seven. They continued <a href=#>co-parenting</a> Austin and Ashley but from two separate homes.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kubC%2ByGaZrqycmr9uv8CcqaKemZiypXnAZqOorF2bvLN5wK6qraGeYq%2B2wMueqWaZnpl6qbHRZpuepZmosm6%2Fx6impGWYnrpw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swifts-ex-boyfriend-may-need-to-avoid-the-black-dog-after-lyrics-laid-bare.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend may need to avoid The Black Dog after lyrics laid bare">&larr;
