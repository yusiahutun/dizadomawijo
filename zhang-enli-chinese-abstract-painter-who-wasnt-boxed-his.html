Spanning his career and featuring more than 100 works, it is curated by Hou Hanru.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking from his studio in Shanghai, Zhang observes the irony of the eye-watering auction prices those early works are fetching.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi on his experimental Hong Kong show</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I sold them for 10,000 yuan [apiece] in the 1990s,” the 55-year-old recalls. Back then, he was a penniless part-time painter teaching at Shanghai’s Donghua University for a monthly salary of 100 yuan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He still remembers the immense elation he felt when he sold his first painting in Shanghai to a Dutch professor from Hong Kong for US$200 in 1990.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I had run out of money at the time. After the sale, I used the money to treat a visiting relative. There was not much material comfort then. The 100 yuan monthly salary helped me fill my stomach at the school canteen. I couldn’t afford painting materials. I found wood myself for making frames. The paintings [from that era] were made on thin canvas … due to the scarcity of materials,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/26/ea3fa88c-2fb1-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_211940.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/26/e8c1f780-2fb1-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_211940.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How Zhang’s life has changed since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His latest paintings, sold through Hauser & Wirth at this month’s West Bund Art & Design fair in Shanghai, fetched between US$200,000 and US$500,000 each.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang says he has changed the way he paints over the years in a way that often parallels changes in the material aspects of Chinese cities as they went from poverty to gluttony.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“<span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>In late 1990s to early 2000s, people’s lives got better. Dining had become a big enjoyment. There were many huge restaurants then which could sit 20 people at a table,” he recalls. Paintings like Eating (2000) and Pub (1998) portray corpulent figures indulging in smoking, and eating and drinking avariciously.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/26/f532245e-2fb1-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_211940.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After that period, he abruptly switched from directly representing his keen observations of human affairs to producing painstakingly realistic paintings of the most mundane items, and of empty spaces seemingly devoid of a human presence. We can see traces of human use in objects, and so the objects are mirrors to the human world, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The year 2000 was a watershed, he said. That was when he started painting objects such as chairs, paper boxes and other kinds of containers. Zhang’s obsession with containers can be seen in a huge installation in the current exhibition, composed of more than 1,000 paper boxes, each of which is covered by his painting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These empty boxes, like the many empty buckets that he painted (three of which were bought in 2007 by the Tate collection in the UK), may be seen as a reaction against our addiction to spectacles and materialistic cravings. The loose, abstract brush marks on the paper boxes are also indicative of a more recent switch to abstraction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/26/f5c84f9c-2fb1-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_211940.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says his expressionistic figurative paintings came from a time when he was filled with youthful rage and anxiety. As the years passed, he has grown more mellow and his perspective has broadened, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“2000 is the year for my change. I did different kinds of [artistic] trials. In the end, I took out the dark hues [from my works]; what is left is lots of lines,” he says. Lines, after all, are a key element in Chinese art, he says, and his recent abstractions are often painted using traditional Chinese techniques, a point of departure from Western abstract and conceptual art development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The way the exhibition is designed suggests that there is always a dialogue between the old and the new for Zhang, rather than a linear evolution from the figurative art to abstraction. Visitors enter through a corridor decorated with old light bulbs and other used items that show his interest in finding human traces through objects and spaces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/26/f790b3e6-2fb1-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_211940.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is also an area near the start of the show displaying six old analogue televisions that show videos of people from all around the world talking about how they have worked with Zhang in organising the show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I feel lucky that I am still filled with passion to create and express myself. Contemporary Chinese artists are staging shows all around the world now to let more people see our works. If I am lucky, I can still live and work for three more decades. There’s still a long road ahead of me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Room that can Move is being held at the Power Station of Art museum at 200 Huayuangang Road, Huangpu District in Shanghai until March 7.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Artist finds success comes as he mellows</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9kGpsbG5fr7WiusZmnKekmWKwqbXNnqqeZZGXwLW%2BwJyrZqiRnru1sdFmrqGnXayutLrTZpmosJWZeqm10g%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-gay-conversion-therapy-survivors-hong-kong-were-given-mentally-traumatic-treatment-learned.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title>&larr;
