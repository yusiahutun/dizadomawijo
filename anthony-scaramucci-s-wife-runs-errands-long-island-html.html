Deidre Scaramucci had filed for divorce, new reports reveal she was eight months pregnant at the time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Further shocking news came when Page Six reported the 38-year-old gave birth two weeks early on Monday and&nbsp;Scaramucci waited the entire work week before seeing his newborn son.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Below is a timeline of events:&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>2011:</span> Soon after&nbsp;Scaramucci's divorce from his first wife Lisa,&nbsp;Scaramucci and Deidre began dating after meeting at his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>July 11, 2014</span>: The Wall Street financier married Deidre in 2014, after the birth of their first child together, Nicholas, in early 2014.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>January 2017:</span>&nbsp;Scaramucci stepped down from his position at SkyBridge Capital after being named as a candidate for Trump's assistant and Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He ultimately failed to be appointed but kept in contact with Trump. &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Thursday, July 6:</span> Deidre filed for divorce from Scaramucci at the Nassau County Supreme Court while she was eight months pregnant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Friday, July 21: </span>&nbsp;Scaramucci was appointed as the new White House Communications Director, taking over Sean Spicer's role.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Monday, July 24:</span>&nbsp;Deidre went into labor two weeks before her due date and gave birth to a baby boy who she named James at a Lenox Hill hospital on the Upper East Side.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The newborn was born two weeks before his due date of August 8. &nbsp;He weighed five pounds and 13 ounces.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While Deidre was delivering her new child, Scaramucci was in West Virginia with Trump&nbsp;for the Boy Scouts Jamboree.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He reportedly sent a text to Deidre that said: 'Congratulations, I'll pray for our child.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Wednesday, July 26:</span>&nbsp;Late on Wednesday night, Scaramucci had his now infamous phone call with journalist Ryan Lizza.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the expletive-filled rant, the Italian New Yorker called the former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus a 'f****** paranoid schizophrenic'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also slammed the chief strategist, saying: 'I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c***'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Thursday, July 27: </span>The next day, the New Yorker published Scaramucci's foul-mouthed rant, creating a news storm around the new official.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The same day, Deidre had her newborn son admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at North Shore Hospital in&nbsp;Manhasset, New York.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Friday, July 28</span>: Instead of flying straight to the hospital to be with his child, Scaramucci flew to New York with Trump on Air Force One for a speech.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was spotted boarding the aircraft not wearing his wedding ring.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Scaramucci tweeted that afternoon: 'Leave civilians out of this. I can take the hits, but I would ask that you would put my family in your thoughts and prayers & nothing more.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As of Friday night, it was reported that&nbsp;Scaramucci still hadn't seen his son.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However another source said late that night, he finally saw James for the first time at the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Saturday, July 29</span>: Deidre was seen out and about in Long Island just days after giving birth and wasn't wearing her wedding ring.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Scaramucci tweeted on Saturday morning: 'Family does not need to be drawn into this. Soon we will learn who in the media has class and who doesn't.
