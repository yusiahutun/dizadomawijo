It is even more contentious if the person involved is a church leader. Dr Charles Stanley divorce has been one of those topics. The termination of his marriage is still a widely discussed matter, two decades on.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ef34fa270497944e.jpg><p class=align-left>Charles Stanley divorce caused a public uproar, especially among his congregants. The world-renown televangelist and author shared bits and pieces of his experience while the separation was going on. Lots of his fans have been curious to find out what happened to him after the devastating breakup.</p><h2>Who is Charles Stanley?</h2><p class=align-left>Charles Frazier Stanley was born on September 25, 1932, in Dry Fork, Virginia, to his parents, Rebecca and Charles Stanley. He grew up in the outskirts of Danville. Unfortunately, his father passed away when Stanley was only nine months old.</p><p class=align-left>The 88-year-old became a born-again Christian at 12 years old and joined the ministry as a young pastor when he turned 14. He pursued a Bachelors degree at the University of Richmond before proceeding to Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas for a Master of Divinity degree.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Charles attained a second Masters degree in Theology from Luther Rice Seminary in Florida. Later on, he studied for a Doctorate in Theology. He is the founder of In Touch Ministries.</p><h2>Who is Charles Stanleys wife?</h2><p class=align-left>The theologian tied the knot in 1955. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married Anna Stanley</a> after a church deacon introduced them. Charles has often stated that she was not the usual type he would go for. Anna was pretty, bright, and artistic. More importantly, she had a deep passion for God. After the wedding, she went out to work while the minister finished at the seminary.</p><p class=align-left>Does Charles Stanley have a daughter? Yes. Together, the couple has two children, Andy Stanley and Becky Stanley. Andy is the founder and senior pastor for the North Point Community Church in Alpharetta, Georgia. Becky Stanley has kept her life private, but she is married and has two children.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dd1e62f70d54cc1d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Mike Rowe's wife?

In his 1991 publication, <i>How to Handle Adversity, </i>the pastor shares how he got busy when they moved to Atlanta. He states that he got married to the ministry and began to neglect his <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p class=align-left>This, he says, caused Anna immense hurt and rejection. It took him several years to realize the damage he had caused. The intimate details of that season are not known publicly, but the couple's children<i> </i>have attempted to share.</p><p class=align-left>In his book, <i>Deep and Wide, </i>Andy Stanley peeks into his parents' marriage. He says that the union had been dead long before his parents took the divorce route.</p><p class=align-left>Andy describes long efforts at marital counselling with trained therapists and doctors. However, he also writes that despite the prevailing issues, his parents opposed divorce, so none of them wanted to initiate it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/faad0f26a780a0fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert divorce story: What really happened</span></p></a><h3>The beginning of the end</h3><p class=align-left>In 1993, Anna Stanley decided to start the process. She filed for divorce but later amended it to a request for ''separate maintenance,'' a form of legal separation. Anna and Stanley could not agree on the terms, so she refiled in 1995, asking for a jury trial.</p><p class=align-left>Tireless efforts to reconcile the couple did not bear any fruit. The separation caused much tension within the Christian community and, more so, Stanley's local church. None of them revealed the details of what led them there, but there was seemingly no other way to go.</p><p class=align-left>The divorce process was long and tedious and affected the First Baptist Church, where he was serving then. Stanley had committed to resigning once the divorce proceedings were finalized, but his church members voted overwhelmingly to retain him as their pastor as long as he did not remarry.</p><p class=align-left>Andy's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">departure</a> from his father's church was also controversial. Dr Charles blamed Andy for siding with his enemies, who believed that he should resign due to the ongoing issues. The two were able to resolve their differences after going through counselling, and his father fully supported his decision to start North Point.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5482574292cc6508.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Harvey: The untold story of Steve Harvey's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The divorce process was eventually concluded in 2000 when it was officially announced. Stanley continued with his ministry despite calls from some clergy that he should step aside for some time to get his life back in order.</p><h2>Charles Stanley steps down</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dd1e62f70d54cc1d.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2020, Charles Stanley <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stepped down</a> from the position of senior pastor at First Baptist Church. He stated that the time had come for him to do so, and George, his assistant of many years, would be taking over the helm.</p><p class=align-left>When he visited Dr Charles Stanley in hospital, George shares that the two had several discussions where the senior pastor had hinted that he wanted to exit. However, he felt that the time was not right.</p><p class=align-left>Charles Stanley has not married since his divorce. He has remained busy writing books and serving at his church. Charles Stanley house is located in Atlanta, Georgia, and he currently lives there.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/791b836014a114c8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is actor Billy Burke's wife?

Several readers may wonder, ''Is Anna Stanley married?'' No, she remained unmarried until the time of her death.</p><h2>What happened to Dr Charles Stanleys wife?</h2><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Anna Stanley passed away in November 2014 at 83 years old after an undisclosed illness. She and Charles rarely spoke after the termination of the marriage. There is also no mention of Anna in recent publications compared to his previous work. Anna was survived by her two children, six grandchildren, one great-grandchild, and two sisters.</p><p class=align-left>Two decades on, the discussion surrounding Charles Stanley divorce still sparks massive debate. The religious fundamentalist has remained mum about his marital problems but continues to serve faithfully in his church.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> recently published the net worth of world-renown televangelist and author <a href=#>Joyce Meyer</a>.
