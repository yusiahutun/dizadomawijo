Wherever he goes for playing, you would find Costeen cheering for him in the stadium. Recently she became an internet sensation after being spotted at the Wimbledon 2022.&nbsp;As of July 2022, she has received around 94K followers on her Instagram profile and often remains in the news for her branded and casual appearance with her only boyfriend. She is around 5 years younger than her only boyfriend Nick with whom she often shares regular pictures on her Instagram and keeps her fans updated about all of their activities.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Costeen was born on 23rd May 2000 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, making her around 22 years old as of 2022. She is a graduate student of a famous university- Australian Catholic University with the degree of Bachelor of Psychological Science. She posted her picture of convocation along with her younger brother who is known to be studying in school and is named George, and he seems to be very close to her. In the picture of convocation, her mother also appeared, who looked around 50 or 55 and seemed to be intelligently and traditionally mannered. But, Costeen herself doesn’t seem to reveal the identity of her mother and father to the media.</p><h3>Costeen Hatzi Career</h3><p>Hatzi came into the news after her commitments with the famous tennis star Nick Kyrgios. She is known to be a famous blogger and interior product business owner. Despite being an owner of her business and blogging, she also publicizes herself on social media. Most recently, she gained more than 18000 followers on her Instagram which is becoming famous these days. Although she is famously known for her relationship with the famous Australian star Nick Kyrgios, she has achieved a lot on her own through blogging, interior designing, and her social media images.</p><p>She began her career at a very young age and is known to be selling all kinds of showpieces including designing mirrors, furniture, cushions, and many household items, importantly known for interior designing and home decoration. She has more than 50,000 reach and followers on her Instagram account and comes from a well-educated and well-mannered family with a good hold of finances.</p><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Nick Kyrgios and Costeen Hatzi are romantically committed to each other and they (most recently) shared a smooch while being together during the training session of Wimbledon 2022 on 4th July 2022, Monday. The tennis player was practicing his games and his girlfriend was sitting courtside when they came close to each other and were spotted on the camera sharing their kisses. Costeen often used to stay close to Nick during most of his tennis practices and most recently he is running for his Wimbledon practice for session 2022. Back in December 2021, the athlete went to Instagram where he officially announced his commitments with Costeen after a split from his long-time girlfriend (with whom he often used to have an on and off relationship) named Chiara Passeri.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Costeen Hatzi Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Costeen Hatzipourganis</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>23 May 2000</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>22 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Social Media Star</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Australian Catholic University</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 2” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 157 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 50 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 110 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Costeen-Hatzi-2.jpg alt width=960 height=701 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her boyfriend?</td><td>Nick Kyrgios</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Relationship with Nick Kyrgios</h4><p>Costeen was also present during all of Nick’s games during the time of the Australian Open in Melbourne Park back in January and during the time, she was described as the key member of his life. In addition to all their linkups, stories, and other rumored or real catch-ups, they both took the help of Instagram announcing that they both have been engaged now. In one of his interviews (back in May), Kyrgios hinted at his romantic relationship and said that he would be marrying soon.</p><p>During the early months of 2022, the Australian tennis star Kyrgios told Australian Daily Telegraph, “Relationships are easy when both people are invested….,.”. Earlier in the past, Nick Kyrgios dated his fellow tennis player Alja Tomljanovic before having his short romantic relationship with Russian ace Anna Kalinskaya, with whom he ended soon after a brief period. On the other hand, the most eligible bachelor and world no. 13 tennis player also used to have an on and off relationship with Chiara Passari and they dated specifically from July 2020 to October 2021.</p><h3>Costeen Hatzi Net Worth</h3><p>It is for sure that Costeen Hatzi, who is the owner of her interior decorating business and the most powerful girlfriend of the eligible bachelor Nick Kyrgois, must be earning a good income because of her multi-professional tasks. She often remains in the news because of her appearances at Nick’s tennis matches and because of their vacation trips. So, having publicity is not a big matter for 22 years old Costeen Hatzi. Surely, she might be earning somewhere around $3 million, giving her enough name and fame in the industry.</p><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunCvzqyrnp2eYrWiwNmiZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./famous-people-with-open-marriages.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Famous People with Open Marriages">&larr;
