Her other beautiful films are Repression (released 2007) and Dad’s Home (2010).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sharon Fall Wiki/Bio</strong></h2><p>Very little is known about Sharon Case’s family. And since she is a very private person, she rarely speaks of her own flesh and blood.&nbsp;So it’s practically impossible to talk about her lineage, and there’s no information about the American actress’s lineage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sharon-case-1.jpg><p>Case, of white ethnicity, however, was born on February 9, 1971, in Detroit, Michigan. She was just 17 years old when her family moved to Japan, where she started modeling.&nbsp;She stayed in Japan for six months before flying back to Los Angeles, where she finally decided to continue acting instead of becoming a full-time model.</p><p>Previously, she had been involved in dancing – an activity that particularly appealed to her as a young girl.&nbsp;As a dancer, she devoted herself entirely to ballet and jazz and made an impressive milestone in artistic performance.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sasha Roiz Married, Wife, Gay, Height, Body Measurements, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married, divorced</strong></h2><p>Celebrities and destroyed married life are related terms because we see too many of them. The same goes for Case.&nbsp;On April 30, 2007, the former model was married to the businessman Sandy Corzine in marriage in Mexico; after more than two years, but the relationship lasted only two years.</p><p>They officially dissolved their marriage in 2009. Although the couple submitted the divorce as irreconcilable differences in the relationship, it was later found that they went through fraud and dishonesty in their married life.&nbsp;Before Case married businessman Sandy Corzine, she had a short-lived relationship with singer Jimmy Wayne.</p><p>Wayne and Case started dating in October 2009. The relationship lasted a few years; then Wayne disappeared from Case’s life, including on their social networking accounts.&nbsp;The couple was really reticent about their relationship. That explains why no one knew about their breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sharon-case-1-1.jpg><p>Currently, Case is single, hot, and without children. She shows no interest in marrying for the second time – after what we see – because of her devastating first marriage.</p><p>The actress may have been a private person, but she has a stunning following on various social sites like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.&nbsp;Her Twitter handle @sharonlcase is adorned with over 129,000 followers.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sheena Parveen Married, Husband, Wiki, Salary, Age</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>After investing nearly four decades of her life in the media industry as an actress, Case has an estimated net worth of $3 million. On January 29, 2010, Case and her best friend and fashion stylist Elif Inanc created their own signature line of fashion jewelry called POMP.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sharon-Case-4.jpg><p>She once described the line, inspired by her love of fashion, as affordable “chic, fun and hip”.&nbsp;There’s no doubt that the megastar does pretty well in her career as an actress and jewelry designer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sharon Case Height, Body Measurement</strong></h2><p>The Young and the Restless’&nbsp;actress’ seductive-peachy body is one thing that has and will forever glue her fans to her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sharon-Case-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Her beauty is enhanced with a height of <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong> (1.70 m).
