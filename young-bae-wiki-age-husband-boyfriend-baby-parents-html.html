Moreover, Bae, who was at the age of 22 at that time, did not know anyone and had only $80 on her name. She arrived on VH1 reality show&nbsp;Black Ink Crew&nbsp;and did everything for survival including working in restaurants and nail shops. Her raw talent eventually solicited her towards&nbsp;a tattoo shop and she was then featured on VH1&nbsp;Black Ink Crew. Her extraordinary monochromatic renderings of tattoos have now overwhelmed the zest of over 785K followers on her Instagram.</p><h3>Quick Information</h3><ul class=quickList><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong> <span>Oct 09, 1984</span></li><li><strong>Age</strong> <span>39 Years, 5 Months</span></li><li><strong>Nationality</strong> <span><a href=#>South Korean</a></span></li><li><strong>Profession</strong> <span><a href=#>Tattoo artist</a></span></li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong> <span>Single (2019)</span></li><li><strong>Divorced</strong> <span>Not Yet</span></li><li><strong>Boyfriend/Dating</strong> <span>Rob (Fiance)</span></li><li><strong>Gay/Lesbian</strong> <span>No</span></li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong> <span>Not Disclosed</span></li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong> <span>Asian</span></li><li><strong>Children/Kids</strong> <span>Nikko</span></li><li><strong>Height</strong> <span>N/A</span></li><li><strong>Education</strong> <span>Chugye University for the Art</span></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>When the tattoo artist&nbsp;Young Bae arrived in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;from South Korea, she didn't even knew how to speak English and spent countless time being homeless.
