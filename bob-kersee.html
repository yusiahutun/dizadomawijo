Bob Kersee trained many elite athletes, including his wife, Olympic gold medallist Jackie Joyner-Kersee.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_life>Early life</span></h2><p>Bob Kersee was born in the Canal Zone, Panama. The exact birth date is not updated. The information regarding his father and mother is not provided. His zodiac sign is Leo. The information about his Siblings is also not disclosed. He follows the Christian religion.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>Moreover, he graduated from California State University Long Beach. More information about his early life is not been updated.</p><h2><span id=Bob_Kersee_8211_Career>Bob Kersee – Career</span></h2><p>Bob Kersee came to enlightenment because of his wife Olympic gold medallist Jackie Joyner-Kersee. In Los Angeles, Joyner competed in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1984 Summer Olympics&nbsp;</a>and won the silver medal in the heptathlon. Moreover, she was the favorite heading into the event but finished five points behind Australian Glynis Nunn. Likewise, in the long jump, she also placed fifth.</p><p>During the 1986 Goodwill Games to score over 7,000 points in a heptathlon event, Joyner was the first woman. In 1986, as the top amateur athlete in the United States, she received the James E. Sullivan Award. Later on, she entered the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea. She earned gold medals in both the heptathlon and the long jump.</p><p>Moreover, she set the still-standing heptathlon world record of 7,291 points. The silver and bronze medalists were Anke Vater-Behmer and Sabine John, both of whom were representing&nbsp;East Germany.</p><p>Five days later, leaping to an Olympic record of&nbsp;7.40&nbsp;m (24&nbsp;ft&nbsp;<span class=frac role=math>3<span class=sr-only>+</span><span class=num>1</span>⁄<span class=den>4</span></span> in) in the long jump Joyner-Kersee won her second gold medal. In the long jump, she was the first American woman to earn a gold medal as well and in the heptathlon, she was the first American woman to earn a gold medal.</p><p>Additionally, at the Games, she faced unfounded allegations of drug use by the men’s 1984 Olympic silver medalist Joaquim Cruz. In 1989 when Darrell Robinson accused her controversial coach this continued the following season, Bobby Kersee, of distributing performance-enhancing drugs.</p><h4>More about his career</h4><p>Additionally, Joyner-Kersee was everyone’s favorite to retain both her World titles earned four years earlier in Rome. However, having won the long jump easily with a 7.32 m (24 ft <span class=frac role=math><span class=num>1</span>⁄<span class=den>4</span></span> in) jump no one would beat, her challenge was dramatically halted. Thus, she slipped on the take-off board and careened headfirst into the pit, avoiding serious injury.</p><p>In 1992 Joyner-Kersee earned her second Olympic gold medal in the heptathlon summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. After that, she also won the bronze medal in the long jump which was won by her friend Heike Drechsler of Germany.</p><p>Joyner-Kersee signed on to play pro basketball in 1996 for the Richmond Rage of the fledgling American Basketball League. She was less successful on the court although she was very popular with the fans. She scored no more than 15 points in any game and appeared in only 17 games.</p><p>Returning to the track, at the 1998 Goodwill Games, scoring 6,502 points Joyner-Kersee won the heptathlon. Two years after retiring, at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney Joyner-Kersee tried to qualify for the long jump event, in Australia. Likewise, she placed sixth at 21–10 ¾.</p><h2><span id=Bob_Kersee_8211_Net_worth_2024>Bob Kersee – Net worth 2024</span></h2><p>Bob Kersee is earning a good amount of money with his career.
