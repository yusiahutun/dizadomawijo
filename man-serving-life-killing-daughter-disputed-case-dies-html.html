Our inability to save him from this fate is one of the deepest disappointments of our lives and careers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Billyâ€™s death marks a sad end to a horrible miscarriage of justice. Billy confessed to a dreadful crime he did not commit. When DNA later proved the actual killer was a career burglar and serial rapist named James Sanders, who had just been released from prison in North Carolina, law enforcement should have faced up to the truth and admitted they obtained a false confession from the grieving and psychologically vulnerable father of a murdered child.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Instead, the prosecution concocted a fantastic new theory that Billy must have cooperated with Sanders -- a man he never met -- in raping and murdering his own daughter in his own home. The State, then, succeeded in convicting both, the real killer and Billy, of a crime only one person actually committed. Billy Cope lost everything -- the last 15 years of his life, his family, and now any chance that this legal atrocity will ever be set right. This is a dark day for justice in South Carolina.'&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKBc32RbXBxZ32Wu26%2FxKutoqaXYrmqssRmoqKknJ67qHnDmqygoKSav26wyKynrqyVmXqkrdKeZJ2hlah7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-horan-multimillionaire-mental-health-issues-spent-1-4m-luxury-cars-cash-payments-strangers-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Horan: Multimillionaire with mental health issues 'spent almost $1.4m on luxury cars and cas">&larr;
