Her mother, Emma Johnson, was a nurse and teacher. Caryn Elaine Johnson chose to change her name later in her life to Whoopi Goldberg because she found the first one rather boring.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Whoopi-goldberg-1.jpg fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt="Whoopi Goldberg Net Worth, Daughter, Husband, Relationships, Kids, Is She Gay?" width=925 height=623 title="Whoopi Goldberg Net Worth, Daughter, Husband, Relationships, Kids, Is She Gay?" data-sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>For her education the actress attended a Catholic school and was also reported to have dropped out of Washington Irving High School.
