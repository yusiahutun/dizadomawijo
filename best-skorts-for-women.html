Unfortunately, there are plenty of warm weather situations that aren't ideal for a skirt. Think: trying to sit comfortably at a picnic, riding a bicycle, and lugging laundry to your local laundromat in the city heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is where the skort comes in — thanks to the built-in shorts, it gives you all the freedom of a skirt without worrying about what a gust of wind might do or thinking about how you'll squat down to tie your shoe. Plus, all the It girls are wearing them at the moment, and it seems like every brand makes its own version. Because of how many choices there are, we set out to find the best athletic skorts by interviewing a few designers, stylists, and influencers as well as testing a bunch out ourselves, We uncovered all the skorts that offer high-quality materials, flattering designs, and special features like pockets and sun protection. So, whether you are looking for the perfect bottom for your workout or picnic in the park, these are the best skorts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-halara-everyday-cloudful-air-fabric-2-in-1-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>HALARA Everyday Cloudful Air-Fabric 2-in-1 Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="HALARA Everyday Cloudful&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; Air 2-in-1 Tennis Skirt-Marvelous" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_YuZWN9DrZuec4_ybHYcRuT30ow=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/halara-everyday-cloudful-air-2-in-1-tennis-skirt-marvelous-f7d4e490817740c69f3183aef4c3474a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Halara</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Halara was my first foray into the skort trend — and I have yet to look back. Living in southern California, I get tired of only wearing shorts whenever it's hot, so a skort seemed like a great alternative to stay cool and feel cute. The Marvelous skort manages to create a pleated skirt that doesn't feel too much like a schoolgirl's cheerleading outfit but still has a bit of a flounce. With its versatile silhouette, I've worn it on dates as well as hikes around Los Angeles. I also love how the high waistband offers tummy control without feeling suffocating. The shorts never rode up nor compressed my legs too much. And believe it or not, the inner pockets actually did fit my iPhone 11. Even after wearing it for hours, I didn't want to take it off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What really sealed the deal, though, was how affordable and inclusive the skort is. Not only is it the cheapest option on the list, but it also comes in 25 colors (plus several different prints) and a size range from XXS to 4X. As someone who is five-foot-three, I loathe styles that are far too long, and the XS fits me perfectly. This design is definitely on the shorter side, but then again, you'll always have the shorts underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-4X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 33 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loukeith-tennis-skirts-for-women></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LouKeith Tennis Skirts for Women</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon LouKeith Tennis Skirts for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wM8iSG3fxv4kx7Zz3BawKSUbV8M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loukeith-tennis-skirts-for-women-cd21e28d7f6b413293b03ee78f55a905.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone intrigued by the trend but not willing to go all in on higher-end versions from brands like Lululemon or Outdoor Voices might like this inexpensive (but still good quality) option from LouKeith. It has all the same qualities — built-in shorts with hidden pockets, lightweight material that wicks away sweat, a high-rise waistband with tummy control, and a flexible fit — just at a much lower price. We appreciate how many colors it comes in, including fun patterns, like paisleys and florals, to add a little more spunk to your wardrobe. You can wear this for any type of workout from tennis to golf to dance, but the shorts do have a tendency to roll up, so keep that in mind before wearing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>26 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-tory-burch-tech-piqu-side-slit-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Burch Tech Piqué Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Tory Burch Tech Piqu&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; Side-Slit Tennis Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p10npuNqjy2HK0_plJC6YO7uubs=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tory-burch-tech-piqu-side-slit-tennis-skirt-65382920b4984d6fa97d12a2f7828ce8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tory Burch</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tory Burch has made somewhat of a comeback in recent years. What was once known for logo ballet flats, now offers a wide range of on-trend clothing still rooted in the brand's preppy, classic Americana ethos. This skort, to us, fits exactly that tone. From the brand's sport line, this skort can be worn to play tennis or just out to brunch with friends. We appreciate that the polyester material feels lightweight enough to sweat in, while the navy blue stripes and logo on the side gives it an elevated touch appropriate for off the court as well. Made from mesh, the shorts underneath will be especially breathable, as will the mini length. We only wish the brand expanded its size range because it's the most limited on the list right now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-offline-by-aerie-all-aces-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Offline by Aerie All Aces Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Offline by Aerie All Aces Tennis Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2GcUjMls7StitostY9gHHyjFR_4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OFFLINE-By-Aerie-All-Aces-Tennis-Skort-aaf98019cea94ed5ab55200eb79cb378.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Offline by Aerie</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When I say this skort feels as light as air, I'm not exaggerating. Aerie kindly gifted me and my fellow InStyle writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a> the style. After trying it out, we were both equally shocked by how comfy it is. "It feels like I'm not wearing pants…it's crazy," says Martyn. "The material is really lightweight but doesn't blow all over the place in the wind and put me in a Marilyn Monroe situation." Despite how lightweight the nylon is, it's not see-through either, even in white. I got the bright blue and olive green, and I'm already brainstorming different ways to style the skorts with pieces already in my closet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I decided to wear it for a balmy, 80-degree walk. After 30 minutes, the material stayed dried and the shorts never rode up. The inner pockets kept my AirPods handy, but when I tried to keep my phone (an iPhone 11 with a heavy case and Popsocket) in there, even though it fit, it weighed the skort down and felt uncomfortable. Another slight con we noticed was that the shorts tended to peep out from under, especially on the sides. Considering the design has a curved hem, this is unavoidable and certainly not a deal breaker — just something to get used to. I personally prefer the curved hem over other pleated designs since it plays up my hips in a flattering way. Plus, it takes me back to my figure skating days — in a good way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Materials:</strong> 88% Polyester, 12% Elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-athelta-transcend-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Versatile</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athelta Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Transcend Skort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-kN2a8qHBMx68S1V5tm3r8Cmr6U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-transcend-skort-41ee06df98a5454f88fe9dc14d996f71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With its unique ruched design and mid-thigh length, this skort can easily pass for a pencil skirt, yet take you straight to a yoga class or hike right after work. "The Transcend skort is one of my favorites because it's so versatile," says plus-size model and actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Kelsie Nick</a>. "You can easily dress it up for a brunch date or wear it for comfy yet stylish travel." Not to mention the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ruching is extremely flattering</a>, as it hugs your curves and hides any trouble spots — scrunch the skort up when you want to be flirty and down for formality. I tried the style on at my local Athleta and was impressed by how buttery soft the material felt. It also has a nice thickness to it, so it's not transparent or flimsy. I could certainly see myself wearing this skort in a formal setting without worrying about the tight fit riding up, thanks to the biker shorts underneath that also feature a secret pocket in the waistband to keep your ID or keys handy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-3X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-girlfriend-collective-sport-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective Sport Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective Sport Skort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W4nzczn8VVKWFzQBbzkkJeYQrGk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/girlfriend-collective-sport-skort-ba7ccdf754274e3db64df93fd97e9ff9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girlfriend Collective</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Girlfriend Collective</a> has stolen the hearts of plus-size influencers like Nicks and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Abby Bible</a> with its inclusive size range and trendy designs that are made from recycled water bottles. Even better, the sustainable fabric is compressive. "The fabric has the perfect amount of compression that makes you feel held in without sacrificing comfort," says Bible. As a New Yorker, Bible swears by the brand's performance fabric during the sweltering summers. "I feel like I never have to worry about sweating in this skort," says Bible. "It doesn't absorb the sweat in a gross way that some athletic fabrics do, but it also provides a lot of breathabilities that just helps prevent sweat." The built-in shorts hit her thighs at the perfect spot, so they don't ride up as often.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle's former commerce writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Alexis Gaskin</a> also tried the skort. "I don't think I've worn a skirt since I was in middle school and as soon as I put this one on from Girlfriend Collective I remembered why I loved them," says Gaskin. "It's the cuteness of a skirt, with the comfort of pants." She noted it runs a bit small, but she was able to find her correct size by checking the size guide. Going up to size 6XL, this style has the most extensive size range on the list. And with 10 different shades to choose from, you can easily mix and match the skort with the brand's coordinating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sports bras and tanks</a>. "I'm personally a sucker for a matching active set moment, but I've also styled my skorts with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>blazer</a> and blouse to work," says Bible. "They're shockingly versatile."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-6XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Materials:</strong> RPET, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-chicos-zenergy-upf-tee-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chico's Zenergy UPF Tee Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chico's Zenergy UPF Tee Skort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UzwzIxuCC7cTRqVoJM3nVMoQJ3k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chicos-zenergy-upf-tee-skort-461eaa54fe094e5d830cd77d82e72a5b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chico's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those that prefer a skort that hits right above the knee, Chico's has just what you're looking for. Fashion blogger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Alison Gary</a> tested more than 12 skorts for her blog Wardrobe Oxygen, and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Zenergy UPF Skort collection from Chico's</a> stood out from the rest. "It performs great for outdoor activities but has a silhouette and fabric that also looks nice for running errands or a casual lunch," says Gary. Living in Maryland, she needs a skort that can withstand the East Coast heat and humidity — the brand's signature Neema stretch fabric does just that. "It dries fast, can look like streetwear, doesn't snag, is super lightweight, and launders beautifully," says Gary. She's also a fan of the undershorts since they don't move around even after hours of sightseeing. The zippers on the pockets ensure none of your knick-knacks will fall out either, and if you plan to play golf in this, it has a little tab built-in specifically for your tee. Needless to say, Gary stocked up on more than one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shaping-spanx-get-moving-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shaping</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Get Moving Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Spanx The Get Moving Skort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hNGTBodwfZ1G6FzqMf9jL_uk_Vo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-The-Get-Moving-Skort-f81f403c609e4b0e8a042c707e0f2379.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leave it to Spanx to design a skort that's not only functional but also butt-boosting with tummy control. Underneath the skirt is the brand's "booty boosting" shorts that sculpt, lift, and hold the bum for an extra-perky look. The design further accentuates your assets with ruffles in the back to create volume, while featuring a straight hem in the front. After being kindly gifted the skort, I wasn't sure if I would personally like this style, but it grew on me. The front didn't ride up between my legs while walking, which happened a lot with other skorts, and the slightly longer back gave me peace of mind as I bent down to tie my shoes. With the high-waisted, contoured waistband, I felt confident in my crop top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I walked for about an hour in the LA sun, and the sweat-wicking fabric and mesh sides kept me cool. The shorts have a silicone strip on the bottom to grip your thighs, and because I'm not used to shapewear, I found this a little uncomfortable at first, but it grew on me with time. I also was impressed that I could hold my phone in the side pocket without feeling like it weighed down the entire skort like other options I tried did. Overall, this skort feels a little more grown-up than others on the list, so I'll be rocking it when I want to channel my inner tennis mom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, elastane, polyester, elastane, cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-workouts-outdoor-voices-the-exercise-3-inch-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Workouts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Voices The Exercise Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Outdoor Voices The Exercise 3&amp;acirc; Skort " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/36QMhYBHTCw2QBueqUhx2zK5M2s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/outdoor-voices-the-exercise-3-skort-1f4edbf093184268b8a68c93d96a4eae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Outdoor Voices</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you can work out in all the skorts on this list, for the best workout pick, I looked for a style that especially excels at wicking sweat and doesn't constrict movement or shift with activity. Recommended by a fitness and fashion blogger, this Outdoor Voices skort checks off all the boxes. "I have tried skorts from other brands but they never seemed to fit right in the waist," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Aly Elizabeth</a>. "With the one from Outdoor Voices, it fits me in the waist, and the grips on the shorts prevent it from riding up, which is a big selling point." The secret behind the no-shift shorts is a strip of silicone on the inside that grips your thighs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With its compressive yet comfortable fit, lightweight fabric, and silhouette that's not too short or too long, she appreciates that "it does a good job with wicking away sweat," adds Elizabeth. The straight skirt with subtle flounce allows for unrestricted movement, so she can wear it while golfing or hanging out with friends. Bonus points for pockets that actually are large enough for her iPhone (with case and pop socket).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On a side note, Martyn and I tested other skorts from Outdoor Voices, and we both found the built-in shorts to be way too tight, even though the skort otherwise fit. We're not completely knocking the brand, but it seems like the fit may not work for every body type. Definitely try out the styles first before going on a shopping spree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tennis-baleaf-womens-high-waisted-tennis-skirts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tennis</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BALEAF Women's High Waisted Tennis Skirts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon BALEAF Women's High Waisted Tennis Skirts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Lp48Z_Pv4QPueP8K3Sbp9X-seWk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baleaf-womens-high-waisted-tennis-skirts-8ec57a22bf2d4d939bedb836422d57f9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to the Aerie Offline skort, this one from Baleaf, which comes in four colors, has a pleated skirt surrounding mini bike shorts to give a charming flounce that also keeps you particularly breezy during a game of tennis. While not a unique feature, the shorts underneath have two pockets to store essentials. But impressively, they stretch out enough to keep an extra tennis ball inside. But you'd never know because the loose skirt then covers the shorts without clinging to the otherwise noticeable bulge on your side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like that it has an over three-inch waistband, which lightly compresses and offers you support during your game. But they don't feel too constrictive, allowing you to move freely. The length of the skirt concerns us a bit, though. It looks particularly short in the back, so anyone with long legs might want to skip this choice unless an ultra-mini is what you're looking for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 4 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fitted-beyond-yoga-spacedye-move-it-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fitted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Beyond Yoga Spacedye Move It Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Beyond Yoga Spacedye Move It Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FQQiQSNNiNHcYIs8h6tAKzYx6DA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beyond-yoga-spacedye-move-it-skirt-47e5595088ac4dfbbf9d83f4cf35521e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beyond Yoga</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It has no pockets.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lots of the skorts on this list don't actually hug the body, but this Beyond Yoga one does. Made from the brand's signature extra-soft, stretchy space-dye fabric, this skort won't feel constrictive, regardless of how tight it is. Much like other Beyond Yoga pieces of the same material, you'll still feel significantly comfortable. The shorts and high-waisted band lightly compress as well, offering you a bit more support in all your movements, on top of just being comfy. We only wish the brand added pockets somewhere on the garment, as these are one of the only ones that don't have them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-4X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, elastane<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-running-lululemon-pace-rival-mid-rise-skirt-long-pace-rival-mid-rise-skirt-long></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Running</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>lululemon Pace Rival Mid-Rise Skirt Long Pace Rival Mid-Rise Skirt Long</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="lululemon Pace Rival Mid-Rise Skirt Long Pace Rival Mid-Rise Skirt Long" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1LvfzjiWrU86uMhIv4IfIiYy1mI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-pace-rival-mid-rise-skirt-long-pace-rival-mid-rise-skirt-long-4f1ba203c0a04f60ab26d86f2f36440f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=4><p>Not only do the shorts have pockets, but also the back has a zippered pocket, giving you more than enough space to keep valuables directly on you.

The lightweight material moves with you as you run, thanks to its four-way stretch, and quickly dries, too. Pick between three different lengths — 17-, 15-, and 12-inches — all of which go up to at least a size 14 (the 15-inch reaches a size 20) to fit a wide variety of bodies. The front skirt lays flat against the body, while the back has a few pleats, allowing the skirt to have more give as you extend your legs. We love that it has two pockets installed in the shorts and an additional one on the back of the skort for valuables, like keys and credit cards. Like with many Lululemon items, this skort runs a bit small, so we recommend sizing up just to be safe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>0-20 | <strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Materials</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You want a skort that keeps you dry during your sweatiest hike but also put-together at an Insta-worthy picnic, right? In that case, look for materials that are lightweight, sweat-wicking, and wrinkle-resistant. Gary has also found that when the inner shorts are made from these performance materials, they do a better job of staying put and not riding up. Though twill and ponte can look cute, she recommends staying away from these heavier fabrics.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pockets</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like your favorite leggings, skorts feature plenty of pockets, located everywhere from the waistband to the innershorts.

"I've tried enough skorts to know this is possible without destroying the line or style of a skort."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Length</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skorts run the gamut from mini to knee-length, and choosing the right length ultimately comes down to your personal preference. "Being 5'3", I usually like a skort that is just above my knees," says Gary. "Long enough for coverage and undershorts that won't ride up, but short enough to look cute and feel proportional. Alternatively, New York City-based fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Beverly Osemwenkhae</a> says a short skort is a great way to try the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>micro-mini trend</a> while still keeping your assets covered. Another thing to keep in mind is the length of the shorts. "The undershorts are likely to ride up if they hit higher than where my thigh begins to taper," says Gary. "Every person's body is different, but if the short has less than a 4-inch inseam, it's guaranteed to ride or roll up, no matter how snug the fit."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the benefits of a skort?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though tennis players have been wearing skorts forever, the general public is just recently rediscovering the various benefits of the design.
