News including The Rundown. She is a beautiful woman with a lot of talent, she is not the oldest person in the media business, but she still managed to show a level of experience that can sometimes be associated with veterans of the industry.</p><p>Of course, her face is a familiar face to anyone watching E! news, but what else can you say about her?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Erin Lim – Bio (Age, Ethnicity)</strong></h2><p>She is a woman of diversity. She was born on April 14, 1990, as Erin Taylor Lim in a mixed ethnic group with Filipino and Chinese roots as well as Spanish and Italian roots. Although the names of her parents were not mentioned, it is known that her mother is Mexican and her father Filipino. On the other hand, she was born and raised in the States.</p><p>Nevertheless, she still connects with both her mother’s and father’s sides. On Twitter, she easily referred to herself as extraterrestrial. She grew up in California at the side of her sister Erica Lim. As she grew up, her family was closely connected.</p><p>After her high school education, the Asian woman earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in television and radio journalism at Chapman University in Orange, California. She went there in 2009, and by 2013 she had already completed her studies.</p><p>Shortly after starting her studies, she took a job at TV Orange as an executive producer and presenter. She was there from 2010 to 2013. She then moved to Singapore, where she worked as an on-air correspondent for E! Network Asia. She also worked as a presenter and producer. In her job there, she covered everything from fashion, music, film, pop culture, and entertainment to everything in between.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Meleasa Houghton Bio, Affairs, Divorce and Facts About Israel Houghton’s Ex-Wife</a></strong></p><p>In 2014 Erin Lim founded her company Black Pearl Productions PTE. LTD.

Among other things, she is also a podium participant in “Live From E!</p><p>In 2017, E! News received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for an outstanding entertainment news program. This is in part due to Lim’s outstanding contribution to the station.</p><p>Besides her work as a media personality and presenter, the charismatic Lim is also an actress. She got a leading role in the TV sitcom “Rules of Tham”. The show, which was broadcast on the largest network in Singapore, ran from September 2013 to November of the same year. However, she still does not have a great resume as an actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Boyfriend And husband</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_124094 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-124094></figure><p>As far as her love life is concerned, Erin Lim is not someone who always reveals so much about her private life, even when she talks about celebrities and their private and love lives in her work. She has always kept everything about her relationship as far away from the public as possible.</p><p>However, it is now known that she is not a married woman, although she is not available on the dating market. She is already an addict and had a relationship with her boyfriend, Lamorne Morris. She has made no effort to hide this relationship.</p><p>In case you do not know him, Lamorne Morris is an actor and comedian famous for his portrayal of Winston Bishop in the Fox TV sitcom “New Girl”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Andrew Frankel Bio, Wife – Bridget Moynahan and Other Cool Facts</a></strong></p><p>Lim and Morris were already known as a couple in 2017 and have remained a couple ever since. The two have made no effort to keep their relationship private, as they exchange information via social media.</p><p>There is already a lot of speculation that they might get married soon. But neither of the two has made any comment on this.</p><p>Before the American comedian and actor, Lim had never made a public date with anyone in the past. This also applies to Morris, who has not been publicly associated with anyone in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksrO1zWajoqVdl7awecCgnGavmaC2bq7Osp2roZWjsW601KyZmqaUYrK1tM2imqKsqWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-watch-yellowjackets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Watch Yellowjackets Season 2 Online Free: Where to Stream">&larr;
