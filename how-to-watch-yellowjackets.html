We have you covered.</p><p>The survival-thriller show debuted on November 14, 2021, and has since gained a ravenous (pardon the pun) cult following. Reviewing its first season, critic site <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Roger Ebert</a> praised Yellowjackets, saying, “One of the strengths of the writing here is how distinctly the writers and performers sketch the characters, both as teenagers and adults. If there’s a lead, it’s probably Melanie Lynskey/Sophie Nélisse as Shauna Sheridan, who seems like the quiet girl on the team but takes a big secret into the crash (it’s debatable that a few too many secrets are taken into the crash in a way that seems manufactured but the character work is strong enough to forgive the manipulation),” Brian Tallerico observed.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/yellowjackets1.jpg><p>He continued: “As the adult Shauna, the always reliable Lynskey perfectly captures a kind of reckless trauma, the way that survivors of the unimaginable often take greater risks and look at the world a little differently—and Nélisse deftly echoes the adult Shauna without ever feeling like she’s impersonating Lynskey. Her best friend Jackie (Ella Purnell) never came home and, well, Shauna knows some things about why that she will never be able to confess.”</p><p>The show was renewed for a second season in mid-December 2021 and just before season two was expected to hit screens, news broke Yellowjackets had already been renewed for a third. “With ‘Yellowjackets’’ runaway success in Season 1 and the pent-up anticipation for Season 2, we wanted to maximize the momentum by fast-tracking Season 3 now,” said Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime and Paramount Media Networks, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>. “The show’s ambition is only exceeded by its execution, and I thank the incredible creative team behind it, including Ashley, Bart, Jonathan, eOne and the Showtime team, for turning this into such a success.” If it sounds like it’s up your alley, read on to find out how to watch Yellowjackets online and for free.</p><h2>When does Yellowjackets season 2&nbsp;come out?</h2><p>Yellowjackets season 2 premiered on SHOWTIME via Paramount+ on Friday, March 24, 2023.</p><h2>How to watch Yellowjackets&nbsp;online</h2><p>How can fans watch Yellowjackets online?

Inspired by the classic 1954 novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding,&nbsp;Yellowjackets&nbsp;is “a shivery synthesis of folk horror, survival story and then-and-now mystery,” per the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York Times</a>.</p><p>“I would say it just was never a question to us, from even early on, that we would do that and that we wouldn’t shy away or blink when it came to the more horrific aspects of what happens to these girls out in the wilderness. I think, in part, that’s because we’re both drama fans, and that’s always been really fun,” the show’s creator, Ashley Lyle, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Thrillist</a>. “And to some extent to have the opportunity to tell a story like this on a network like Showtime that’s going to allow us to do whatever we want, it felt like we couldn’t squander it.”</p><p>She continued: “But I think also, on a storytelling level, it just felt really important to us that we really honor the stakes of the circumstances that these girls find themselves in. So much of this show is about the frailty of the human body, the horror of, as you put it, being a teenage girl. I think that it’s something that we really wanted to hammer home in terms of just the potential horror—not just of being out there—but of what can happen to you. We didn’t want to shy away from it.”</p><p>Yellowjackets is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount+</a>.
